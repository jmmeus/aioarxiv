      <title>Exploring the Impact of Generative AI on Cross-Border E-Commerce Brand Building in Chinese Tianjin's Manufacturing Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the brand construction of cross-border e-commerce companies in the manufacturing industry in Tianjin, China. We examine the direct effects of generative AI on productivity, the mediating role of productivity in the relationship between generative AI and brand building, and the moderating influence of cross-border e-commerce strategies by developing and testing a comprehensive model. Based on data collected from 210 manufacturing firms in Chinese Tianjin, the results show that generative AI significantly increases productivity, which positively affects branding. Moreover, cross-border e-commerce strategies were found to moderate the impact of generative AI on branding, underscoring the importance of these strategies for using AI technologies to compete successfully in the global marketplace. This study provides valuable theory, empiricism and practical contributions to understanding the role AI plays in manufacturing and electronic commerce. Besides, this study tests several hypotheses to quantify these impacts using a structured model that consists of independent, dependent, mediating and moderating variables. Information is collected through a comprehensive survey of manufacturers in Chinese Tianjin and analyzed to test our proposed model. This study was analyzed and summarized using quantitative analysis, regression and structural equations (PLS-SEM).</description>

      <title>Equivalent of Non-Trivial Riemann Zeros Condition in Matrix Representation and Particle Anti-Particle Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hermitian matrix can be formed for a large enough cutoff N on the number of terms in the Riemann zeta function. At zeros, the matrix trace equals the off-diagonal sum. Riemann's hypothesis is true if and only if the condition is satisfied. It suggests a relationship between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the matrix formed. By forming a matrix with Riemann non-trivial zero, the quantum field vacuum loop level diagram can be opened exactly by coupling the matrix with an anti-particle annihilation operator, which gives rise to asymmetry between matter and anti-matter.</description>

      <title>Finding "Good Views" of Electrocardiogram Signals for Inferring Abnormalities in Cardiac Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are an established technique to screen for abnormal cardiac signals. Recent work has established that it is possible to detect arrhythmia directly from the ECG signal using deep learning algorithms. While a few prior approaches with contrastive learning have been successful, the best way to define a positive sample remains an open question. In this project, we investigate several ways to define positive samples, and assess which approach yields the best performance in a downstream task of classifying arrhythmia. We explore spatiotemporal invariances, generic augmentations, demographic similarities, cardiac rhythms, and wave attributes of ECG as potential ways to match positive samples. We then evaluate each strategy with downstream task performance, and find that learned representations invariant to patient identity are powerful in arrhythmia detection. We made our code available in: https://github.com/mandiehyewon/goodviews_ecg.git</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting of Radiation Exposure for Spaceflight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended human presence beyond low-Earth orbit (BLEO) during missions to the Moon and Mars will pose significant challenges in the near future. A primary health risk associated with these missions is radiation exposure, primarily from galatic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs). While GCRs present a more consistent, albeit modulated threat, SPEs are harder to predict and can deliver acute doses over short periods. Currently NASA utilizes analytical tools for monitoring the space radiation environment in order to make decisions of immediate action to shelter astronauts. However this reactive approach could be significantly enhanced by predictive models that can forecast radiation exposure in advance, ideally hours ahead of major events, while providing estimates of prediction uncertainty to improve decision-making. In this work we present a machine learning approach for forecasting radiation exposure in BLEO using multimodal time-series data including direct solar imagery from Solar Dynamics Observatory, X-ray flux measurements from GOES missions, and radiation dose measurements from the BioSentinel satellite that was launched as part of Artemis~1 mission. To our knowledge, this is the first time full-disk solar imagery has been used to forecast radiation exposure. We demonstrate that our model can predict the onset of increased radiation due to an SPE event, as well as the radiation decay profile after an event has occurred.</description>

      <title>Racism in the Machine: Visualization Ethics in Digital Humanities Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualizations are inherently rhetorical, and therefore bias-laden visual artifacts that contain both explicit and implicit arguments. The implicit arguments depicted in data visualizations are the net result of many seemingly minor decisions about data and design from inception of a research project through to final publication of the visualization. Data workflow, selected visualization formats, and individual design decisions made within those formats all frame and direct the possible range of interpretation, and the potential for harm of any data visualization. Considering this, it is imperative that we take an ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations. Therefore, we have suggested an ethical data visualization workflow with the dual aim of minimizing harm to the subjects of our study and the audiences viewing our visualization, while also maximizing the explanatory capacity and effectiveness of the visualization itself. To explain this ethical data visualization workflow, we examine two recent digital mapping projects, Racial Terror Lynchings and Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence.</description>

      <title>EEG-DCNet: A Fast and Accurate MI-EEG Dilated CNN Classification Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) classification is a critical and challenging task in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, which plays a significant role in assisting patients with functional impairments to regain mobility. We present a novel multi-scale atrous convolutional neural network (CNN) model called EEG-dilated convolution network (DCNet) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the EEG-based MI classification tasks. We incorporate the $1\times1$ convolutional layer and utilize the multi-branch parallel atrous convolutional architecture in EEG-DCNet to capture the highly nonlinear characteristics and multi-scale features of the EEG signals. Moreover, we utilize the sliding window to enhance the temporal consistency and utilize the attension mechanism to improve the accuracy of recognizing user intentions. The experimental results (via the BCI-IV-2a ,BCI-IV-2b and the High-Gamma datasets) show that EEG-DCNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of classification accuracy and Kappa scores. Furthermore, since EEG-DCNet requires less number of parameters, the training efficiency and memory consumption are also improved. The experiment code is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/Kanyooo/EEG-DCNet}{here}.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Dynamic Analysis of a Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sink with Electromagnetic Coil for Vibration Suppression and Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a system comprising a linear oscillator (LO) equipped with a Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sink (VI-NES) and a coil. The LO's damping and stiffness coefficients are represented by ( C ) and ( k ), respectively, while a ball inside the LO moves within a cavity, colliding with the walls at both ends. The primary focus is on optimizing the cavity length (( L_c )) and the coefficient of restitution (( \kappa )) and coil parameter () using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The motion equations for the LO incorporating the VI-NES are derived, considering the electromagnetic force (( F_e )) and contact force (( F_c )). The study also explores the energy harvesting circuit, which generates electric power by connecting a load resistance to the coil, transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy. The dynamic behavior of the system is analyzed, highlighting the transition from predictable patterns to chaotic responses. Efficiency metrics are defined to measure the VI-NES's performance in absorbing and dissipating excitation energy. The optimization formulation addresses the influence of initial conditions, proposing a multi-objective approach to handle uncertainties. Validation against existing studies confirms the reliability of the proposed optimization method. The results demonstrate that optimizing both ( L_c ) and ( \kappa ) using GA effectively minimizes the amplitude response of the LO, outperforming approximate methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Neurally-Guided Program Induction for ARC-AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ARC-AGI is an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize out-of-distribution is a crucial quality. Under the program induction paradigm, we present a series of experiments that reveal the efficiency and generalization characteristics of various neurally-guided program induction approaches. The three paradigms we consider are Learning the grid space, Learning the program space, and Learning the transform space. We implement and experiment thoroughly on the first two, and retain the second one for ARC-AGI submission. After identifying the strengths and weaknesses of both of these approaches, we suggest the third as a potential solution, and run preliminary experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantity versus Diversity: Influence of Data on Detecting EEG Pathology with Advanced ML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of quantity and diversity of data on the performance of various machine-learning models for detecting general EEG pathology. We utilized an EEG dataset of 2,993 recordings from Temple University Hospital and a dataset of 55,787 recordings from Elmiko Biosignals sp. z o.o. The latter contains data from 39 hospitals and a diverse patient set with varied conditions. Thus, we introduce the Elmiko dataset - the largest publicly available EEG corpus. Our findings show that small and consistent datasets enable a wide range of models to achieve high accuracy; however, variations in pathological conditions, recording protocols, and labeling standards lead to significant performance degradation. Nonetheless, increasing the number of available recordings improves predictive accuracy and may even compensate for data diversity, particularly in neural networks based on attention mechanism or transformer architecture. A meta-model that combined these networks with a gradient-boosting approach using handcrafted features demonstrated superior performance across varied datasets.</description>

      <title>AnyECG: Foundational Models for Electrocardiogram Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. Experimental results in anomaly detection, arrhythmia detection, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG signal analysis demonstrate that AnyECG learns common ECG knowledge from data and significantly outperforms cutting-edge methods in each respective task.</description>

      <title>Generative AI on the Edge: Architecture and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-a-Box strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, e.g., in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-the-shelf edge devices remains largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50\% CPU and RAM usage. We conclude that GenAI on the edge offers localized inference in remote or bandwidth-constrained environments in 6G networks without reliance on cloud infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Llama Guard 3-1B-INT4, a compact and efficient Llama Guard model, which has been open-sourced to the community during Meta Connect 2024. We demonstrate that Llama Guard 3-1B-INT4 can be deployed on resource-constrained devices, achieving a throughput of at least 30 tokens per second and a time-to-first-token of 2.5 seconds or less on a commodity Android mobile CPU. Notably, our experiments show that Llama Guard 3-1B-INT4 attains comparable or superior safety moderation scores to its larger counterpart, Llama Guard 3-1B, despite being approximately 7 times smaller in size (440MB).</description>

      <title>Gauging Flavor Symmetries of the Standard Model: from Dark Energy to Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry from Higher Dimensions in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics has global Family flavor symmetries corresponding to the 3 families in the Standard Model. It has been shown that the breaking of these symmetries at low energy produces Dark Energy which is the dominant component of the energy density of the Universe. It has also been shown that this model of Dark Energy not only explains the accelerated expansion of the universe but has additional observational consequences and makes verifiable predictions. This model allows a space-time dependent Dark Energy as indicated by recent observations. Further, the collapse of space dependent Dark Energy configurations leads to the formation of Dark Energy Black Holes resulting in verifiable predictions. We examine the implications of these symmetries at high energies and in the Early Universe. We consider what might happen if these global symmetries get gauged and that the global symmetries today are just a consequence of the gauge fields acquiring a constant vacuum expectation value below some energy scale v. Since, we have not yet seen signatures of such gauge fields at any of our particle accelerators, this would imply that v is greater than the electroweak scale. In the early Universe, when these gauge fields would be dynamical, the Higgs would not yet have acquired a non-zero vacuum expectation value and all Standard Model particles would be massless. The gauging of these global symmetries is desirable from a high energy and quantum gravity perspective. The chiral dynamics has a natural interpretation in terms of D Branes and our 4-dimensional Universe embedded in higher dimensions. Anomaly cancellation in this scenario results from the sum of the cubic terms vanishing. Finally, the analysis in this article can provide an explanation for one of the long standing mysteries of the natural world: the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in our Universe.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Deep Learning Model for Emotion Detection using raw EEG Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications in behavioural research, human-computer interaction, and mental health depend on the ability to recognize emotions. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) data, this work presents a hybrid quantum deep learning technique. Conventional EEG-based emotion recognition techniques are limited by noise and high-dimensional data complexity, which make feature extraction difficult. To tackle these issues, our method combines traditional deep learning classification with quantum-enhanced feature extraction. To identify important brain wave patterns, Bandpass filtering and Welch method are used as preprocessing techniques on EEG data. Intricate inter-band interactions that are essential for determining emotional states are captured by mapping frequency band power attributes (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) to quantum representations. Entanglement and rotation gates are used in a hybrid quantum circuit to maximize the model's sensitivity to EEG patterns associated with different emotions. Promising results from evaluation on a test dataset indicate the model's potential for accurate emotion recognition. The model will be extended for real-time applications and multi-class categorization in future study, which could improve EEG-based mental health screening instruments. This method offers a promising tool for applications in adaptive human-computer systems and mental health monitoring by showcasing the possibilities of fusing traditional deep learning with quantum processing for reliable, scalable emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Generating CKM Using Others' Data: Cross-AP CKM Inference with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time communication. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs in dense networks. For a dense network with CKMs of existing access points (APs), it will be useful to efficiently generate CKMs of potentially new APs with only AP location information. The generation of inferred CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient initial CKM generation, environment-aware AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. Considering that different APs in the same region share the same physical environment, there exists a natural correlation between the channel knowledge of different APs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Methodology for Sample Augmentation in EEG Biomarker Studies for Alzheimers Risk Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Dementia, marked by cognitive decline, is a global health challenge. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading type, accounts for ~70% of cases. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures show promise in identifying AD risk, but obtaining large samples for reliable comparisons is challenging. Objective: This study integrates signal processing, harmonization, and statistical techniques to enhance sample size and improve AD risk classification reliability. Methods: We used advanced EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, harmonization, and propensity score matching (PSM) to balance healthy non-carriers (HC) and asymptomatic E280A mutation carriers (ACr). Data from four databases were harmonized to adjust site effects while preserving covariates like age and sex. PSM ratios (2:1, 5:1, 10:1) were applied to assess sample size impact on model performance. The final dataset underwent machine learning analysis with decision trees and cross-validation for robust results. Results: Balancing sample sizes via PSM significantly improved classification accuracy, ranging from 0.92 to 0.96 across ratios. This approach enabled precise risk identification even with limited samples. Conclusion: Integrating data processing, harmonization, and balancing techniques improves AD risk classification accuracy, offering potential for other neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BSM physics, on which the now standard inflationary cosmology with baryosynthesis and dark matter/energy is based, inevitably leads to cosmological scenarios beyond this standard model, involving specific model dependent choice of models and parameters of BSM physics. Such model dependent cosmological predictions may have already found confirmations in the positive results of direct dark matter searches by DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA experiments, interpretation of the results of Gravitational Wave experiments in terms of Primordial Black Hole merging, observation of Stochastic GravitationalWave background by Pulsar Timing Arrays, indications of early galaxy formation in the observations of James Webb Space Telescope and searches for cosmic antihelium in the AMS02 experiment. We discuss the open questions in studies of these signatures of BSM cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research papers are well structured documents. They have text, figures, equations, tables etc., to covey their ideas and findings. They are divided into sections like Introduction, Model, Experiments etc., which deal with different aspects of research. Characteristics like these set research papers apart from ordinary documents and allows us to significantly improve their summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel system, SlideSpwan, that takes PDF of a research document as an input and generates a quality presentation providing it's summary in a visual and concise fashion. The system first converts the PDF of the paper to an XML document that has the structural information about various elements. Then a machine learning model, trained on PS5K dataset and Aminer 9.5K Insights dataset (that we introduce), is used to predict salience of each sentence in the paper. Sentences for slides are selected using ILP and clustered based on their similarity with each cluster being given a suitable title. Finally a slide is generated by placing any graphical element referenced in the selected sentences next to them. Experiments on a test set of 650 pairs of papers and slides demonstrate that our system generates presentations with better quality.</description>

      <title>MAS-Attention: Memory-Aware Stream Processing for Attention Acceleration on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.</description>

      <title>Automatic EEG Independent Component Classification Using ICLabel in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ICLabel is an important plug-in function in EEGLAB, the most widely used software for EEG data processing. A powerful approach to automated processing of EEG data involves decomposing the data by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and then classifying the resulting independent components (ICs) using ICLabel. While EEGLAB pipelines support high-performance computing (HPC) platforms running the open-source Octave interpreter, the ICLabel plug-in is incompatible with Octave because of its specialized neural network architecture. To enhance cross-platform compatibility, we developed a Python version of ICLabel that uses standard EEGLAB data structures. We compared ICLabel MATLAB and Python implementations to data from 14 subjects. ICLabel returns the likelihood of classification in 7 classes of components for each ICA component. The returned IC classifications were virtually identical between Python and MATLAB, with differences in classification percentage below 0.001%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positively and efficiently transformed workflows in many domains. One such domain with significant potential for LLM integration is the Internet of Things (IoT), where this integration brings new opportunities for improved decision making and system interaction. In this paper, we explore the various roles of LLMs in IoT, with a focus on their reasoning capabilities. We show how LLM-IoT integration can facilitate advanced decision making and contextual understanding in a variety of IoT scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the integration of LLMs with edge, fog, and cloud computing paradigms, and show how this synergy can optimize resource utilization, enhance real-time processing, and provide scalable solutions for complex IoT applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study covering IoT-LLM integration between edge, fog, and cloud systems. Additionally, we propose a novel system model for industrial IoT applications that leverages LLM-based collective intelligence to enable predictive maintenance and condition monitoring. Finally, we highlight key challenges and open issues that provide insights for future research in the field of LLM-IoT integration.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Banking Competition on Interest Rates for Household Consumption Loans in the Euro Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of banking competition on interest rates for household consumption loans in the Euro Area from 2014 to 2020. Utilizing a panel data regression approach, we analyze how various factors, including local banking competition, influence the interest rates set by banks across 13 Euro-area countries. Our key independent variable, local banking competition, is measured by the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults. Control variables include the ECB interest rate, euro exchange rate, real GDP growth rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, bank business volumes, and country risk. We address potential endogeneity and heterogeneity biases and employ both Fixed Effects and Hausman-Taylor models to ensure robust results. Our findings indicate that higher local banking competition is associated with a slight increase in interest rates for household loans. Additionally, factors such as ECB interest rate, country risk, and euro appreciation significantly affect interest rates. The results offer insights into how competitive dynamics in the banking sector influence borrowing costs for households, providing valuable implications for policymakers and financial institutions in the Euro Area.</description>

      <title>Incentives to Build Houses, Trade Houses, or Trade House Building Skills in Simulated Worlds under Various Governing Systems or Institutions: Comparing Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning to Generative Agent-based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that social institutions impact human motivations to produce different behaviours, such as amount of working or specialisation in labor. With advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), now it is possible to perform in-silico simulations to test various hypotheses around this topic. Here, I simulate two somewhat similar worlds using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework of the AI-Economist and generative agent-based model (GABM) framework of the Concordia. In the extended versions of the AI-Economist and Concordia, the agents are able to build houses, trade houses, and trade house building skill. Moreover, along the individualistic-collectivists axis, there are a set of three governing systems: Full-Libertarian, Semi-Libertarian/Utilitarian, and Full-Utilitarian. Additionally, in the extended AI-Economist, the Semi-Libertarian/Utilitarian system is further divided to a set of three governing institutions along the discriminative axis: Inclusive, Arbitrary, and Extractive. Building on these, I am able to show that among governing systems and institutions of the extended AI-Economist, under the Semi-Libertarian/Utilitarian and Inclusive government, the ratios of building houses to trading houses and trading house building skill are higher than the rest. Furthermore, I am able to show that in the extended Concordia when the central government care about equality in the society, the Full-Utilitarian system generates agents building more houses and trading more house building skill. In contrast, these economic activities are higher under the Full-Libertarian system when the central government cares about productivity in the society. Overall, the focus of this paper is to compare and contrast two advanced techniques of AI, MARL and GABM, to simulate a similar social phenomena with limitations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Prediction for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems with Channel Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures, known as beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs), have been proposed to enhance reflection efficiency and expand RIS capabilities. However, their passive nature, non-diagonal reflection matrix, and the large number of coupled reflecting elements complicate the channel state information (CSI) estimation process. The challenge further escalates in scenarios with fast-varying channels. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing novel joint channel estimation and prediction strategies with low overhead and high accuracy for two different RIS architectures in a BD-RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output system under correlated fast-fading environments with channel aging. The channel estimation procedure utilizes the Tucker2 decomposition with bilinear alternative least squares, which is exploited to decompose the cascade channels of the BD-RIS-assisted system into effective channels of reduced dimension. The channel prediction framework is based on a convolutional neural network combined with an autoregressive predictor. The estimated/predicted CSI is then utilized to optimize the RIS phase shifts aiming at the maximization of the downlink sum rate. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is robust to channel aging, and exhibits a high estimation accuracy. Moreover, our scheme can deliver a high average downlink sum rate, outperforming other state-of-the-art channel estimation methods. The results also reveal a remarkable reduction in pilot overhead of up to 98\% compared to baseline schemes, all imposing low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Capture Point Control Using Thruster Dynamics and QP-Based Optimization for Harpy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work aims to make significant strides in understanding unexplored locomotion control paradigms based on the integration of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring. These techniques are commonly seen in nature, such as Chukar birds using their wings to run on a nearly vertical wall. In this work, we developed a capture-point-based controller integrated with a quadratic programming (QP) solver which is used to create a thruster-assisted dynamic bipedal walking controller for our state-of-the-art Harpy platform. Harpy is a bipedal robot capable of legged-aerial locomotion using its legs and thrusters attached to its main frame. While capture point control based on centroidal models for bipedal systems has been extensively studied, the use of these thrusters in determining the capture point for a bipedal robot has not been extensively explored. The addition of these external thrust forces can lead to interesting interpretations of locomotion, such as virtual buoyancy studied in aquatic-legged locomotion. In this work, we derive a thruster-assisted bipedal walking with the capture point controller and implement it in simulation to study its performance.</description>

      <title>Analytic Continuation by Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic continuation aims to reconstruct real-time spectral functions from imaginary-time Green's functions; however, this process is notoriously ill-posed and challenging to solve. We propose a novel neural network architecture, named the Feature Learning Network (FL-net), to enhance the prediction accuracy of spectral functions, achieving an improvement of at least $20\%$ over traditional methods, such as the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), and previous neural network approaches. Furthermore, we develop an analytical method to evaluate the robustness of the proposed network. Using this method, we demonstrate that increasing the hidden dimensionality of FL-net, while leading to lower loss, results in decreased robustness. Overall, our model provides valuable insights into effectively addressing the complex challenges associated with analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Fast convolution algorithm for state space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast, robust algorithm for applying a matrix transfer function of a linear time invariant system (LTI) in time domain. Computing $L$ states of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LTI appears to require $L$ matrix-vector multiplications. We demonstrate that, for any finite user-selected accuracy, the number of matrix-vector multiplications can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}\left(\log_{2}L\right)$ (within an $\mathcal{O}\left(L\right)$ algorithm). The algorithm uses an approximation of the rational transfer function in the z-domain by a matrix polynomial of degree $2^{N+1}-1$, where $N$ is chosen to achieve any user-selected accuracy. Importantly, using a cascade implementation in time domain, applying the transfer function requires only $N+1$ matrix-vector multiplications. We note that LTI systems are used in state space models (SSMs) for modeling long range dependencies where $L$ is large. In applications where the state matrix of LTI system is approximated by a structured matrix, the computational cost is further reduced. We briefly describe several structured approximations of matrices that can be used for such purpose.</description>

      <title>Almost sure well-posedness and orbital stability for Schr\"odinger equation with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the almost sure well-posedness theory and orbital stability for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with potential \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l} i \partial_t u+\Delta u-V(x)u+|u|^{2}u=0,\ (x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^4 \times \mathbb{R}, \\ \left.u\right|_{t=0}=f \in H ^s(\mathbb{R}^4), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $\frac{1}{3}&lt;s&lt;1$ and $V(x):\mathbb{R}^4\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies appropriate conditions. The main idea in the proofs is based on Strichartz spaces as well as variants of local smoothing, inhomogeneous local smoothing and maximal function spaces. To our best knowledge, this is the first almost sure orbital stability result.</description>

      <title>Soil Characterization of Watermelon Field through Internet of Things: A New Approach to Soil Salinity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern agricultural industry, technology plays a crucial role in the advancement of cultivation. To increase crop productivity, soil require some specific characteristics. For watermelon cultivation, soil needs to be sandy and of high temperature with proper irrigation. This research aims to design and implement an intelligent IoT-based soil characterization system for the watermelon field to measure the soil characteristics. IoT based developed system measures moisture, temperature, and pH of soil using different sensors, and the sensor data is uploaded to the cloud via Arduino and Raspberry Pi, from where users can obtain the data using mobile application and webpage developed for this system. To ensure the precision of the framework, this study includes the comparison between the readings of the soil parameters by the existing field soil meters, the values obtained from the sensors integrated IoT system, and data obtained from soil science laboratory. Excessive salinity in soil affects the watermelon yield. This paper proposes a model for the measurement of soil salinity based on soil resistivity. It establishes a relationship between soil salinity and soil resistivity from the data obtained in the laboratory using artificial neural network (ANN).</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Approximate Intermittent Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteryless IoT systems face energy constraints exacerbated by checkpointing overhead. Approximate computing offers solutions but demands manual expertise, limiting scalability. This paper presents CheckMate, an automated framework leveraging LLMs for context-aware code approximations. CheckMate integrates validation of LLM-generated approximations to ensure correct execution and employs Bayesian optimization to fine-tune approximation parameters autonomously, eliminating the need for developer input. Tested across six IoT applications, it reduces power cycles by up to 60% with an accuracy loss of just 8%, outperforming semi-automated tools like ACCEPT in speedup and accuracy. CheckMate's results establish it as a robust, user-friendly tool and a foundational step toward automated approximation frameworks for intermittent computing.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Tiny Machine Learning Techniques for Embedded Acoustic Emission Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares machine learning approaches with different input data formats for the classification of acoustic emission (AE) signals. AE signals are a promising monitoring technique in many structural health monitoring applications. Machine learning has been demonstrated as an effective data analysis method, classifying different AE signals according to the damage mechanism they represent. These classifications can be performed based on the entire AE waveform or specific features that have been extracted from it. However, it is currently unknown which of these approaches is preferred. With the goal of model deployment on resource-constrained embedded Internet of Things (IoT) systems, this work evaluates and compares both approaches in terms of classification accuracy, memory requirement, processing time, and energy consumption. To accomplish this, features are extracted and carefully selected, neural network models are designed and optimized for each input data scenario, and the models are deployed on a low-power IoT node. The comparative analysis reveals that all models can achieve high classification accuracies of over 99\%, but that embedded feature extraction is computationally expensive. Consequently, models utilizing the raw AE signal as input have the fastest processing speed and thus the lowest energy consumption, which comes at the cost of a larger memory requirement.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost Monopulse Receiver with Enhanced Estimation Accuracy Via Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a low-cost monopulse receiver with an enhanced direction of arrival (DoA) estimation accuracy via deep neural network (DNN) is proposed. The entire system is composed of a 4-element patch array, a fully planar symmetrical monopulse comparator network, and a down conversion link. Unlike the conventional design topology, the proposed monopulse comparator network is configured by four novel port-transformation rat-race couplers. In specific, the proposed coupler is designed to symmetrically allocate the sum ({\Sigma}) / delta ({\Delta}) ports with input ports, where a 360{\deg} phase delay crossover is designed to transform the unsymmetrical ports in the conventional rat-race coupler. This new rat-race coupler resolves the issues in conventional monopulse receiver comparator network design using multilayer and expensive fabrication technology. To verify the design theory, a prototype of the proposed planar monopulse comparator network operating at 2 GHz is designed, simulated, and measured. In addition, the monopulse radiation patterns and direction of arrival are also decently evaluated. To further boost the accuracy of angular information, a deep neural network is introduced to map the misaligned target angular positions in the measurement to the actual physical location under detection.</description>

      <title>SnapMem: Snapshot-based 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over long periods. Existing scene representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, have significant limitations. They oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as individual objects, with inter-object relationships described by restrictive texts, making it difficult to answer queries that require nuanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, which hampers their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose SnapMem, a novel snapshot-based scene representation serving as 3D scene memory for embodied agents. SnapMem employs informative images, termed Memory Snapshots, to capture rich visual information of explored regions. It also integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-that enable agents to make informed exploration decisions by considering both known and potential new information. Meanwhile, to support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we further present an incremental construction pipeline for SnapMem, as well as an effective memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that SnapMem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments over extended periods, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain simple formulas for the matrix elements of the resolvent operator (the Green's function) in any finite set of square integrable basis. These formulas are suitable for numerical computations whether the basis elements are orthogonal or not. A byproduct of our findings is an expression for the normalized eigenvectors of a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues. We give a physical application as an illustration of how useful these results can be.</description>

      <title>An Improved Dung Beetle Optimizer for Random Forest Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), this paper proposes an improved algorithm based on circle mapping and longitudinal-horizontal crossover strategy (CICRDBO). First, the Circle method is used to map the initial population to increase diversity. Second, the longitudinal-horizontal crossover strategy is applied to enhance the global search ability by ensuring the position updates of the dung beetle. Simulations were conducted on 10 benchmark test functions, and the results demonstrate that the improved algorithm performs well in both convergence speed and optimization accuracy. The improved algorithm is further applied to the hyperparameter selection of the Random Forest classification algorithm for binary classification prediction in the retail industry. Various combination comparisons prove the practicality of the improved algorithm, followed by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis.</description>

Abstract: For a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ we consider the first-order theory, that is defined by set $P$ and relation $\leqslant$. The problem of undecidability of combinatorial theories attracts significant attention. Recently A. Wires proved the undecidability of the elementary theory of Young lattice and also established the maximal definability property of this theory. The purpose of this article is to obtain the same results for another graded lattice, which has much in common with Young lattice: Young--Fibonacci lattice. As Wires does for Young lattice, for the proof of undecidability we define Arithmetic into this theory.</description>

      <title>A robust time-split linearized explicit/implicit technique for solving a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model: an application to floods in Cameroon far north region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a time-split linearized explicit/implicit approach for solving a two-dimensional hydrodynamic flow model with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The time-split technique is employed to upwind the convection term and to treat the friction slope so that the numerical oscillations and stability are well controlled. A suitable time step restriction for stability and convergence accurate of the new algorithm is established using the $L^{\infty}(0,T; L^{2})$-norm. Under a time step requirement, some numerical examples confirm the theoretical studies and suggest that the proposed computational technique is spatial fourth-order accurate and temporal second-order convergent. An application to floods observed in the far north region of Cameroon is considered and discussed.</description>

      <title>Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM Inference Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Compressibility and volume variations due to composition in multicomponent fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For single components fluids, vanishing isothermal compressibility implies that the mass density is constant, but the same conclusion is unknown for multicomponent fluids. Here the volume remains affected by changes of the composition. In the present paper we discuss an apparently natural way to conceptualise, based on derivatives of the Gibbs function g, this 'volume change due to composition' as a compression. In this way the phenomenon becomes quantitatively comparable to the usual coefficients of compressibility. This is a first step to investigate the range of validity of the constant density approximation of multicomponent fluids. As an illustration, three different aqueous solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ranking probabilistic forecasting models with different loss functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduced various statistical performance metrics, based on the pinball loss and the empirical coverage, for the ranking of probabilistic forecasting models. We tested the ability of the proposed metrics to determine the top performing forecasting model and investigated the use of which metric corresponds to the highest average per-trade profit in the out-of-sample period. Our findings show that for the considered trading strategy, ranking the forecasting models according to the coverage of quantile forecasts used in the trading hours exhibits a superior economic performance.</description>

      <title>Constraining symmetron fields with a levitated optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetron, one of the light scalar fields introduced by dark energy theories, is thought to modify the gravitational force when it couples to matter. However, detecting the symmetron field is challenging due to its screening behavior in the high-density environment of traditional measurements. In this paper, we propose a scheme to set constraints on the parameters of the symmetron with a levitated optomechanical system, in which a nanosphere serves as a testing mass coupled to an optical cavity. By measuring the frequency shift of the probe transmission spectrum, we can establish constraints for our scheme by calculating the symmetron-induced influence. These refined constraints improve by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to current force-based detection methods, which offer new opportunities for the dark energy detection.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Adaptive Trajectory Tracking and Motion Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the trajectory tracking and motion control problems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). A parameter adaptive control framework for AVs is proposed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw stability. While establishing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and three robust controllers, the control framework addresses trajectory tracking and motion control in a modular fashion, without introducing complexity into each controller. The robust performance has been guaranteed in three robust controllers by considering the parameter uncertainties, mismatch of unmodeled subsystem as well as external disturbance, comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of uncertain parameters are identified by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, while the boundaries of three robust factors are determined through combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian optimization machine learning methods, reducing the conservatism of the controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically. The simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim joint platform demonstrate that the proposed methodology considerably improves tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robust performance, guaranteeing the feasibility and capability of driving in extreme scenarios.</description>

      <title>UVCG: Leveraging Temporal Consistency for Universal Video Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security risks of AI-driven video editing have garnered significant attention. Although recent studies indicate that adding perturbations to images can protect them from malicious edits, directly applying image-based methods to perturb each frame in a video becomes ineffective, as video editing techniques leverage the consistency of inter-frame information to restore individually perturbed content. To address this challenge, we leverage the temporal consistency of video content to propose a straightforward and efficient, yet highly effective and broadly applicable approach, Universal Video Consistency Guard (UVCG). UVCG embeds the content of another video(target video) within a protected video by introducing continuous, imperceptible perturbations which has the ability to force the encoder of editing models to map continuous inputs to misaligned continuous outputs, thereby inhibiting the generation of videos consistent with the intended textual prompts. Additionally leveraging similarity in perturbations between adjacent frames, we improve the computational efficiency of perturbation generation by employing a perturbation-reuse strategy. We applied UVCG across various versions of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) and assessed its effectiveness and generalizability across multiple LDM-based editing pipelines. The results confirm the effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency of our approach in safeguarding video content from unauthorized modifications.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding-Empowered MmWave Massive MIMO Joint Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-complexity and fast hybrid beamforming design for joint communications and sensing (JCAS) based on deep unfolding. We first derive closed-form expressions for the gradients of the communications sum rate and sensing beampattern error with respect to the analog and digital precoders. Building on this, we develop a deep neural network as an unfolded version of the projected gradient ascent algorithm, which we refer to as UPGANet. This approach efficiently optimizes the communication-sensing performance tradeoff with fast convergence, enabled by the learned step sizes. UPGANet preserves the interpretability and flexibility of the conventional PGA optimizer while enhancing performance through data training. Our simulations show that UPGANet achieves up to a 33.5% higher communications sum rate and 2.5 dB lower beampattern error compared to conventional designs based on successive convex approximation and Riemannian manifold optimization. Additionally, it reduces runtime and computational complexity by up to 65% compared to PGA without unfolding.</description>

Abstract: Facing the thermal management challenges of Wide Bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, this study highlights the use of ARX parametric models, which provide accurate temperature predictions without requiring detailed understanding of component thickness disparities or material physical properties, relying solely on experimental measurements. These parametric models emerge as a reliable alternative to FEM simulations and conventional thermal models, significantly simplifying system identification while ensuring high result accuracy.</description>

      <title>Will an AI with Private Information Allow Itself to Be Switched Off?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of goals could cause an AI to disable its off switch because "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead" (Russell 2019). Prior theoretical work on this shutdown problem assumes that humans know everything that AIs do. In practice, however, humans have only limited information. Moreover, in many of the settings where the shutdown problem is most concerning, AIs might have vast amounts of private information. To capture these differences in knowledge, we introduce the Partially Observable Off-Switch Game (POSG), a game-theoretic model of the shutdown problem with asymmetric information. Unlike when the human has full observability, we find that in optimal play, even AI agents assisting perfectly rational humans sometimes avoid shutdown. As expected, increasing the amount of communication or information available always increases (or leaves unchanged) the agents' expected common payoff. But counterintuitively, introducing bounded communication can make the AI defer to the human less in optimal play even though communication mitigates information asymmetry. In particular, communication sometimes enables new optimal behavior requiring strategic AI deference to achieve outcomes that were previously inaccessible. Thus, designing safe artificial agents in the presence of asymmetric information requires careful consideration of the tradeoffs between maximizing payoffs (potentially myopically) and maintaining AIs' incentives to defer to humans.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Longevity amongst SSNIT Pensioners in Ghana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper statistically analysed pensioner longevity in Ghana. It fundamentally sought to ascertain the significant determinants of longevity amongst Ghanaian pensioners, specifically, SSNIT pensioners by estimating the mortality rate of SSNIT pensioners, determining the factors that significantly affect the longevity of the average SSNIT pensioner and constructing a predictive model for predicting the longevity of SSNIT pensioners in Ghana. Secondary data was obtained from the leading pension provider in Ghana, SSNIT. The results of the study revealed that the total number of male deaths was significantly greater, about four times more, than the total number of female deaths. There was sufficient evidence that there exists a lower rate of death among female pensioners as compared to male pensioners. Furthermore, a significant number of the SSNIT pensioners used in the analysis survived less than 8 years after retirement before their death and the average basic salary of the pensioners who lived less than 8 years after retirement was GH 7741.827 cedis and served for 35.65 years on average. On the contrary, it was observed that pensioners who lived more than 8 years after retirement had an average basic salary of GH 5544.20 cedis and served for 31.49 years on average. In conclusion, predictors such as basic salary, the number of years of service in the workforce, the age of the pensioner before death and the gender of the pensioner were statistically significant in predicting the number of years a SSNIT pensioner survived after retirement before death that is, whether a particular SSNIT pensioner survived less than 8 years or 8 years and above after retirement. The authors recommend to employees that, their health should be of great priority as every increase in the service year increases the likelihood of a SSNIT pensioner surviving less than 8 years after retirement by 22.36%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio deployments and spectrum planning can benefit from path loss predictions. Obstructions along a communications link are often considered implicitly or through derived metrics such as representative clutter height or total obstruction depth. In this paper, we propose a path-specific path loss prediction method that uses convolutional neural networks to automatically perform feature extraction from high-resolution obstruction height maps. Our methods result in low prediction error in a variety of environments without requiring derived obstruction metrics.</description>

      <title>Observability in Fog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fog Computing provides computational resources close to the end user, supporting low-latency and high-bandwidth communications. It supports IoT applications, enabling real-time data processing, analytics, and decision-making at the edge of the network. However, the high distribution of its constituent nodes and resource-restricted devices interconnected by heterogeneous and unreliable networks makes it challenging to execute service maintenance and troubleshooting, increasing the time to restore the application after failures and not guaranteeing the service level agreements. In such a scenario, increasing the observability of Fog applications and services may speed up troubleshooting and increase their availability. An observability system is a data-intensive service, and Fog Computing could have its nodes and channels saturated with an additional load. In this work, we detail the three pillars of observability (metrics, log, and traces), discuss the challenges, and clarify the approaches for increasing the observability of services in Fog environments. Furthermore, the system architecture that supports observability in Fog, related tools, and technologies are presented, providing a comprehensive discussion on this subject. An example of a solution shows how a real-world application can benefit from increased observability in this environment. Finally, there is a discussion about the future directions of Fog observability.</description>

      <title>Constraining model parameters in f(Q,C) gravity: Observational analysis and geometric diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of $f(Q,C)$ gravity with $f(Q,C)=\alpha Q+\beta C$, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $C$ encapsulates cosmological expansion terms. Three parameterizations of the EoS for dark energy, $\omega=\omega_{0}+\omega_{1}z$, $\omega=\omega_{0}+\frac{\omega_{1}z(1+z)}{1+z^{2}}$ and $\omega=\omega_{0}+\frac{\omega_{1}z^{2}}{1+z^{2}}$ are tested using the Hubble, Hubble plus BAO, and Hubble plus BAO plus Pantheon datasets to constrain model parameters. The resulting Hubble and deceleration parameters reveal a transition from deceleration to acceleration, supporting current cosmic acceleration observations. Analysis of the energy density and pressure confirms positive energy density and a negative pressure for dark energy, potentially driving the late-time acceleration. We examine energy conditions, showing compliance with NEC, WEC and DEC, while SEC remains negative, supporting an accelerated expansion. Statefinder diagnostics suggest that two of the EoS parameterizations lead to Quintessence-like behavior with a time-varying dark energy component, while the third closely approaches $\Lambda$CDM showing slight deviations consistent with recent observations. Sound speed analysis demonstrates the physical stability of all parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Acoustic Emission with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic emission signals have been shown to accompany avalanche-like events in materials, such as dislocation avalanches in crystalline solids, collapse of voids in porous matter or domain wall movement in ferroics. The data provided by acoustic emission measurements is tremendously rich, but it is rather challenging to precisely connect it to the characteristics of the triggering avalanche. In our work we propose a machine learning based method with which one can infer microscopic details of dislocation avalanches in micropillar compression tests from merely acoustic emission data. As it is demonstrated in the paper, this approach is suitable for the prediction of the force-time response as it can provide outstanding prediction for the temporal location of avalanches and can also predict the magnitude of individual deformation events. Various descriptors (including frequency dependent and independent ones) are utilised in our machine learning approach and their importance in the prediction is analysed. The transferability of the method to other specimen sizes is also demonstrated and the possible application in more generic settings is discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Scalability of Circuit Cutting Techniques for Practical Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit cutting allows quantum circuits larger than the available hardware to be executed. Cutting techniques split circuits into smaller subcircuits, run them on the hardware, and recombine results through classical post-processing. Circuit cutting techniques have been extensively researched over the last five years and it been adopted by major quantum hardware vendors as part of their scaling roadmaps. We examine whether current circuit cutting techniques are practical for orchestrating executions on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We conduct a resource estimation-based benchmarking of important quantum applications and different types of circuit cutting techniques. Our applications include practically relevant algorithms, such as Hamiltonian simulation, kernels such as quantum Fourier transform and more. To cut these applications, we use IBM's Qiskit cutting tool. We estimate resources for subcircuits using Microsoft's Azure Quantum Resource Estimator and develop models to determine the qubit, quantum and classical runtime needs of circuit cutting. We demonstrate that while circuit cutting works for small-scale systems, the exponential growth of the quantum runtime and the classical post-processing overhead as the qubit count increases renders it impractical for larger quantum systems with current implementation strategies. As we transition from noisy quantum hardware to fault-tolerance, our work provides important guidance for the design of quantum software and runtime systems.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of Everett's relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everett's "Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics" (RSQM), which appeared in Reviews of Modern Physics, is based on his thesis "The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction". The most noteworthy property of these works is the claim by other authors that these works are the seminal contribution to Many Worlds theories of branching realities and the claim that practical laboratory experimental tests of RSQM are not possible. This report shows that Everett's two works describe a formulation of quantum mechanics that contradicts an overwhelming body of experimental physics.</description>

      <title>PP-LEM: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Clearance Mechanism for Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving clearance mechanism for Local Energy Markets (PP-LEM), designed for computational efficiency and social welfare. PP-LEM incorporates a novel competitive game-theoretical clearance mechanism, modelled as a Stackelberg Game. Based on this mechanism, a privacy-preserving market model is developed using a partially homomorphic cryptosystem, allowing buyers' reaction function calculations to be executed over encrypted data without exposing sensitive information of both buyers and sellers. The comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that PP-LEM is highly effective in delivering an incentive clearance mechanism with computational efficiency, enabling it to clear the market for 200 users within the order of seconds while concurrently protecting user privacy. Compared to the state of the art, PP-LEM achieves improved computational efficiency without compromising social welfare while still providing user privacy protection.</description>

Abstract: Phase-locked loop (PLL), conceived in 1932 by H. Bellescize, has been the basic electronic component in the development of communication technology from the early analog radio receptors to modern digital civil and military facilities. Traditionally, the analysis is conducted by modeling the dynamical behavior of phase and frequency errors, hence following a phase reduction approach. One of the main goals of the present work is to describe and investigate the dynamics of a PLL node by representing it in full state-space, here called non reductionist model, without the usual design simplifications i.e., considering different input and output frequencies and not neglecting the higher frequencies components generated in the phase detection process. On the one hand, this approach complicates the use of analytical tools but on the other hand it permits an efficient numerical approach that can be used for precise definition of regions in parameters space that show the boundaries between synchronization and non synchronization regimes, even when noise is considered. Results show that the PLL node can be simulated in a more realistic way using the state-space model and that a number of design-relevant aspects can now be investigated numerically.</description>

      <title>Efficient Self-Improvement in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Model-Level Judge-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-improvement in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for enhancing their reliability and robustness. However, current methods often rely heavily on MLLMs themselves as judges, leading to high computational costs and potential pitfalls like reward hacking and model collapse. This paper introduces a novel, model-level judge-free self-improvement framework. Our approach employs a controlled feedback mechanism while eliminating the need for MLLMs in the verification loop. We generate preference learning pairs using a controllable hallucination mechanism and optimize data quality by leveraging lightweight, contrastive language-image encoders to evaluate and reverse pairs when necessary. Evaluations across public benchmarks and our newly introduced IC dataset designed to challenge hallucination control demonstrate that our model outperforms conventional techniques. We achieve superior precision and recall with significantly lower computational demands. This method offers an efficient pathway to scalable self-improvement in MLLMs, balancing performance gains with reduced resource requirements.</description>

      <title>OpenAD: Open-World Autonomous Driving Benchmark for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-world autonomous driving encompasses domain generalization and open-vocabulary. Domain generalization refers to the capabilities of autonomous driving systems across different scenarios and sensor parameter configurations. Open vocabulary pertains to the ability to recognize various semantic categories not encountered during training. In this paper, we introduce OpenAD, the first real-world open-world autonomous driving benchmark for 3D object detection. OpenAD is built on a corner case discovery and annotation pipeline integrating with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The proposed pipeline annotates corner case objects in a unified format for five autonomous driving perception datasets with 2000 scenarios. In addition, we devise evaluation methodologies and evaluate various 2D and 3D open-world and specialized models. Moreover, we propose a vision-centric 3D open-world object detection baseline and further introduce an ensemble method by fusing general and specialized models to address the issue of lower precision in existing open-world methods for the OpenAD benchmark. Annotations, toolkit code, and all evaluation codes will be released.</description>

      <title>MUSE-VL: Modeling Unified VLM through Semantic Discrete Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MUSE-VL, a Unified Vision-Language Model through Semantic discrete Encoding for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, the research community has begun exploring unified models for visual generation and understanding. However, existing vision tokenizers (e.g., VQGAN) only consider low-level information, which makes it difficult to align with texture semantic features. This results in high training complexity and necessitates a large amount of training data to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, their performance is still far from dedicated understanding models. This paper proposes Semantic Discrete Encoding (SDE), which effectively aligns the information of visual tokens and language tokens by adding semantic constraints to the visual tokenizer. This greatly reduces training difficulty and improves the performance of the unified model. The proposed model significantly surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in various vision-language benchmarks and achieves better performance than dedicated understanding models.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Strikes Back: From Single-Image Symmetry Detection to 3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is a ubiquitous and fundamental property in the visual world, serving as a critical cue for perception and structure interpretation. This paper investigates the detection of 3D reflection symmetry from a single RGB image, and reveals its significant benefit on single-image 3D generation. We introduce Reflect3D, a scalable, zero-shot symmetry detector capable of robust generalization to diverse and real-world scenarios. Inspired by the success of foundation models, our method scales up symmetry detection with a transformer-based architecture. We also leverage generative priors from multi-view diffusion models to address the inherent ambiguity in single-view symmetry detection. Extensive evaluations on various data sources demonstrate that Reflect3D establishes a new state-of-the-art in single-image symmetry detection. Furthermore, we show the practical benefit of incorporating detected symmetry into single-image 3D generation pipelines through a symmetry-aware optimization process. The integration of symmetry significantly enhances the structural accuracy, cohesiveness, and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D geometry and textures, advancing the capabilities of 3D content creation.</description>

      <title>PROGRESSOR: A Perceptually Guided Reward Estimator with Self-Supervised Online Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PROGRESSOR, a novel framework that learns a task-agnostic reward function from videos, enabling policy training through goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) without manual supervision. Underlying this reward is an estimate of the distribution over task progress as a function of the current, initial, and goal observations that is learned in a self-supervised fashion. Crucially, PROGRESSOR refines rewards adversarially during online RL training by pushing back predictions for out-of-distribution observations, to mitigate distribution shift inherent in non-expert observations. Utilizing this progress prediction as a dense reward together with an adversarial push-back, we show that PROGRESSOR enables robots to learn complex behaviors without any external supervision. Pretrained on large-scale egocentric human video from EPIC-KITCHENS, PROGRESSOR requires no fine-tuning on in-domain task-specific data for generalization to real-robot offline RL under noisy demonstrations, outperforming contemporary methods that provide dense visual reward for robotic learning. Our findings highlight the potential of PROGRESSOR for scalable robotic applications where direct action labels and task-specific rewards are not readily available.</description>

      <title>I2VControl: Disentangled and Unified Video Motion Synthesis Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video synthesis techniques are undergoing rapid progress, with controllability being a significant aspect of practical usability for end-users. Although text condition is an effective way to guide video synthesis, capturing the correct joint distribution between text descriptions and video motion remains a substantial challenge. In this paper, we present a disentangled and unified framework, namely I2VControl, that unifies multiple motion control tasks in image-to-video synthesis. Our approach partitions the video into individual motion units and represents each unit with disentangled control signals, which allows for various control types to be flexibly combined within our single system. Furthermore, our methodology seamlessly integrates as a plug-in for pre-trained models and remains agnostic to specific model architectures. We conduct extensive experiments, achieving excellent performance on various control tasks, and our method further facilitates user-driven creative combinations, enhancing innovation and creativity.

      <title>Integrating Dual Prototypes for Task-Wise Adaption in Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to acquire new classes while conserving historical knowledge incrementally. Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to catastrophic forgetting that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, a task-wise adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DPTA. The code will be open-sourced after the paper is published.</description>

      <title>Exploring Aleatoric Uncertainty in Object Detection via Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets collected from the open world unavoidably suffer from various forms of randomness or noiseness, leading to the ubiquity of aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Quantifying such uncertainty is particularly pivotal for object detection, where images contain multi-scale objects with occlusion, obscureness, and even noisy annotations, in contrast to images with centric and similar-scale objects in classification. This paper suggests modeling and exploiting the uncertainty inherent in object detection data with vision foundation models and develops a data-centric reliable training paradigm. Technically, we propose to estimate the data uncertainty of each object instance based on the feature space of vision foundation models, which are trained on ultra-large-scale datasets and able to exhibit universal data representation. In particular, we assume a mixture-of-Gaussian structure of the object features and devise Mahalanobis distance-based measures to quantify the data uncertainty. Furthermore, we suggest two curial and practical usages of the estimated uncertainty: 1) for defining uncertainty-aware sample filter to abandon noisy and redundant instances to avoid over-fitting, and 2) for defining sample adaptive regularizer to balance easy/hard samples for adaptive training. The estimated aleatoric uncertainty serves as an extra level of annotations of the dataset, so it can be utilized in a plug-and-play manner with any model. Extensive empirical studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed aleatoric uncertainty measure on various advanced detection models and challenging benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Barriers to Adopting Design for Assembly in Modular Product Architecture: Development of a Conceptual Model Through Content Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the barriers to integrating Design for Assembly (DFA) principles within modular product architectures established using the Modular Function Deployment (MFD) method -- a critical stage for deploying mass customization production while reducing costs. Despite the potential benefits of DFA, its application in modular architectures development remains underutilized, due to a mix of challenges. Through content analysis of qualitative data gathered from a focus group and interviews with industry experts and practitioners, we identified four major categories of such challenges, or barriers to adoption of DFA: technological, economic, regulatory, and organizational (TERO). Key challenges include compliance with regulatory requirements for data usage, intellectual property concerns, and limited availability of quantitative data in the initial stages of MFD. The findings reveal that multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to addressing these barriers, as it enhances informed decision making and eases the practical integration of DFA. By analyzing insights from both academic literature and industrial practice, this research develops a conceptual model that describes the main issues of applying DFA in MFD, providing a valuable guide for companies aiming to improve their modular products assembly process. Ultimately, this study provides groundwork to support industry practitioners in overcoming existing barriers, promoting more cost effective, high quality modular design processes with the inclusion of efficient assembly considerations.</description>

      <title>Omegance: A Single Parameter for Various Granularities in Diffusion-Based Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a single parameter $\omega$, to effectively control granularity in diffusion-based synthesis. This parameter is incorporated during the denoising steps of the diffusion model's reverse process. Our approach does not require model retraining, architectural modifications, or additional computational overhead during inference, yet enables precise control over the level of details in the generated outputs. Moreover, spatial masks or denoising schedules with varying $\omega$ values can be applied to achieve region-specific or timestep-specific granularity control. Prior knowledge of image composition from control signals or reference images further facilitates the creation of precise $\omega$ masks for granularity control on specific objects. To highlight the parameter's role in controlling subtle detail variations, the technique is named Omegance, combining "omega" and "nuance". Our method demonstrates impressive performance across various image and video synthesis tasks and is adaptable to advanced diffusion models.

      <title>MTS-UNMixers: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Channel-Time Dual Unmixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series data provide a robust framework for future predictions by leveraging information across multiple dimensions, ensuring broad applicability in practical scenarios. However, their high dimensionality and mixing patterns pose significant challenges in establishing an interpretable and explicit mapping between historical and future series, as well as extracting long-range feature dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a channel-time dual unmixing network for multivariate time series forecasting (named MTS-UNMixer), which decomposes the entire series into critical bases and coefficients across both the time and channel dimensions. This approach establishes a robust sharing mechanism between historical and future series, enabling accurate representation and enhancing physical interpretability. Specifically, MTS-UNMixers represent sequences over time as a mixture of multiple trends and cycles, with the time-correlated representation coefficients shared across both historical and future time periods. In contrast, sequence over channels can be decomposed into multiple tick-wise bases, which characterize the channel correlations and are shared across the whole series. To estimate the shared time-dependent coefficients, a vanilla Mamba network is employed, leveraging its alignment with directional causality. Conversely, a bidirectional Mamba network is utilized to model the shared channel-correlated bases, accommodating noncausal relationships. Experimental results show that MTS-UNMixers significantly outperform existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/ZHU-0108/MTS-UNMixers.</description>

      <title>DiagramQG: A Dataset for Generating Concept-Focused Questions from Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Question Generation (VQG) has gained significant attention due to its potential in educational applications. However, VQG researches mainly focus on natural images, neglecting diagrams in educational materials used to assess students' conceptual understanding. To address this gap, we introduce DiagramQG, a dataset containing 8,372 diagrams and 19,475 questions across various subjects. DiagramQG introduces concept and target text constraints, guiding the model to generate concept-focused questions for educational purposes. Meanwhile, we present the Hierarchical Knowledge Integration framework for Diagram Question Generation (HKI-DQG) as a strong baseline. This framework obtains multi-scale patches of diagrams and acquires knowledge using a visual language model with frozen parameters. It then integrates knowledge, text constraints and patches to generate concept-focused questions. We evaluate the performance of existing VQG models, open-source and closed-source vision-language models, and HKI-DQG on the DiagramQG dataset. Our HKI-DQG outperform existing methods, demonstrating that it serves as a strong baseline. Furthermore, to assess its generalizability, we apply HKI-DQG to two other VQG datasets of natural images, namely VQG-COCO and K-VQG, achieving state-of-the-art performance.The dataset and code are available at https://dxzxy12138.github.io/diagramqg-home.</description>

      <title>MVBoost: Boost 3D Reconstruction with Multi-View Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object reconstruction have been remarkable, yet most current 3D models rely heavily on existing 3D datasets. The scarcity of diverse 3D datasets results in limited generalization capabilities of 3D reconstruction models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for boosting 3D reconstruction with multi-view refinement (MVBoost) by generating pseudo-GT data. The key of MVBoost is combining the advantages of the high accuracy of the multi-view generation model and the consistency of the 3D reconstruction model to create a reliable data source. Specifically, given a single-view input image, we employ a multi-view diffusion model to generate multiple views, followed by a large 3D reconstruction model to produce consistent 3D data. MVBoost then adaptively refines these multi-view images, rendered from the consistent 3D data, to build a large-scale multi-view dataset for training a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model. Additionally, the input view optimization is designed to optimize the corresponding viewpoints based on the user's input image, ensuring that the most important viewpoint is accurately tailored to the user's needs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction results and robust generalization compared to prior works.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-modal Large Language Models via Visual Token Grouping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to perceive data formats beyond text, significantly advancing a range of downstream applications, such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with processing high-resolution images and videos pose a barrier to their broader adoption. To address this challenge, compressing vision tokens in MLLMs has emerged as a promising approach to reduce inference costs. While existing methods conduct token reduction in the feature alignment phase. In this paper, we introduce VisToG, a novel grouping mechanism that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained vision encoders to group similar image segments without the need for segmentation masks. Specifically, we concatenate semantic tokens to represent image semantic segments after the linear projection layer before feeding into the vision encoder. Besides, with the isolated attention we adopt, VisToG can identify and eliminate redundant visual tokens utilizing the prior knowledge in the pre-trained vision encoder, which effectively reduces computational demands. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VisToG, maintaining 98.1% of the original performance while achieving a reduction of over 27\% inference time.</description>

      <title>Leaning Time-Varying Instruments for Identifying Causal Effects in Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Querying causal effects from time-series data is important across various fields, including healthcare, economics, climate science, and epidemiology. However, this task becomes complex in the existence of time-varying latent confounders, which affect both treatment and outcome variables over time and can introduce bias in causal effect estimation. Traditional instrumental variable (IV) methods are limited in addressing such complexities due to the need for predefined IVs or strong assumptions that do not hold in dynamic settings. To tackle these issues, we develop a novel Time-varying Conditional Instrumental Variables (CIV) for Debiasing causal effect estimation, referred to as TDCIV. TDCIV leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models to disentangle and learn the representations of time-varying CIV and its conditioning set from proxy variables without prior knowledge. Under the assumptions of the Markov property and availability of proxy variables, we theoretically establish the validity of these learned representations for addressing the biases from time-varying latent confounders, thus enabling accurate causal effect estimation. Our proposed TDCIV is the first to effectively learn time-varying CIV and its associated conditioning set without relying on domain-specific knowledge.</description>

      <title>What is the amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we re-evaluate the estimates of dust mass in galaxies and demonstrate that current dust models are incomplete and based on a priori assumptions. These models suffer from a circularity problem and account for only a small portion of dust, specifically submicron-sized grains. They overlook larger dust particles and other macroscopic bodies, despite observational evidence supporting their existence. This evidence includes the observed (sub)millimeter excess in dust emission spectra and the power-law size distribution with an index {\gamma} ~ 3.5-4.0, which has been measured for large particles and compact bodies across diverse environments. Examples of these large particles include large dust grains and meteoroids detected by satellites, near-Earth objects colliding with Earth, fragments in the Main Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt, interstellar 'Oumuamua-like objects, and exoplanets. As a result, dust-type baryonic dark matter may be more abundant throughout the galaxy by one order of magnitude or even more than previously assumed, with a significant portion of its mass concentrated in large compact bodies. Additionally, black holes may contribute significantly to the total mass of baryonic dark matter. Consequently, current galaxy models do not provide reliable estimates of baryonic mass in galaxies. Clearly, a substantially larger amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies would have major implications for theories of galaxy dynamics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Beyond Walking: A Large-Scale Image-Text Benchmark for Text-based Person Anomaly Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based person search aims to retrieve specific individuals across camera networks using natural language descriptions. However, current benchmarks often exhibit biases towards common actions like walking or standing, neglecting the critical need for identifying abnormal behaviors in real-world scenarios. To meet such demands, we propose a new task, text-based person anomaly search, locating pedestrians engaged in both routine or anomalous activities via text. To enable the training and evaluation of this new task, we construct a large-scale image-text Pedestrian Anomaly Behavior (PAB) benchmark, featuring a broad spectrum of actions, e.g., running, performing, playing soccer, and the corresponding anomalies, e.g., lying, being hit, and falling of the same identity. The training set of PAB comprises 1,013,605 synthesized image-text pairs of both normalities and anomalies, while the test set includes 1,978 real-world image-text pairs. To validate the potential of PAB, we introduce a cross-modal pose-aware framework, which integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair sampling. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that synthetic training data facilitates the fine-grained behavior retrieval in the real-world test set, while the proposed pose-aware method further improves the recall@1 by 2.88%. We will release the dataset, code, and checkpoints to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.</description>

      <title>Network Inversion and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools across various applications, yet their decision-making process often remains opaque, leading to them being perceived as "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns about their interpretability and reliability, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Network inversion techniques offer a solution by allowing us to peek inside these black boxes, revealing the features and patterns learned by the networks behind their decision-making processes and thereby provide valuable insights into how neural networks arrive at their conclusions, making them more interpretable and trustworthy. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to network inversion using a meticulously conditioned generator that learns the data distribution in the input space of the trained neural network, enabling the reconstruction of inputs that would most likely lead to the desired outputs. To capture the diversity in the input space for a given output, instead of simply revealing the conditioning labels to the generator, we encode the conditioning label information into vectors and intermediate matrices and further minimize the cosine similarity between features of the generated images. Additionally, we incorporate feature orthogonality as a regularization term to boost image diversity which penalises the deviations of the Gram matrix of the features from the identity matrix, ensuring orthogonality and promoting distinct, non-redundant representations for each label. The paper concludes by exploring immediate applications of the proposed network inversion approach in interpretability, out-of-distribution detection, and training data reconstruction.</description>

      <title>BiSC: An algorithm for discovering generalized permutation patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theorems relating permutations with objects in other fields of mathematics are often stated in terms of avoided patterns. Examples include various classes of Schubert varieties from algebraic geometry (Billey and Abe 2013), commuting functions in analysis (Baxter 1964), beta-shifts in dynamical systems (Elizalde 2011) and homology of representations (Sundaram 1994). We present a new algorithm, BiSC, that, given any set of permutations, outputs a conjecture for describing the set in terms of avoided patterns. The algorithm automatically conjectures the statements of known theorems such as the descriptions of smooth (Lakshmibai and Sandhya 1990) and forest-like permutations (Bousquet-M{\'e}lou and Butler 2007), Baxter permutations (Chung et al. 1978), stack-sortable (Knuth 1975) and West-2-stack-sortable permutations (West 1990). The algorithm has also been used to discover new theorems and conjectures related to the dihedral and alternating subgroups of the symmetric group, Young tableaux, Wilf-equivalences, and sorting devices.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Networks and Super-Quadratic Gains for RIS Systems with Mutual Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose decoupling networks for the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) array as a solution to benefit from the mutual coupling between the reflecting elements. In particular, we show that when incorporating these networks, the system model reduces to the same structure as if no mutual coupling is present. Hence, all algorithms and theoretical discussions neglecting mutual coupling can be directly applied when mutual coupling is present by utilizing our proposed decoupling networks. For example, by including decoupling networks, the channel gain maximization in RIS-aided single-input single-output (SISO) systems does not require an iterative algorithm but is given in closed form as opposed to using no decoupling network. In addition, this closed-form solution allows to analytically analyze scenarios under mutual coupling resulting in novel connections to the conventional transmit array gain. In particular, we show that super-quadratic (up to quartic) channel gains w.r.t. the number of RIS elements are possible and, therefore, the system with mutual coupling performs significantly better than the conventional uncoupled system in which only squared gains are possible. We consider diagonal as well as beyond diagonal (BD)-RISs and give various analytical and numerical results, including the inevitable losses at the RIS array. In addition, simulation results validate the superior performance of decoupling networks w.r.t. the channel gain compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by Kutnar, Maru\v si\v c and Zhang in 2012 that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $10p$, where $p$ is a prime and $p\ne 7$, contains a Hamilton path, except for graphs $X$ arising from the action of PSL$(2, s^m)$ on cosets of $\mathbb{Z}_s^m\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{\frac{s^m-1}{10}}$, where $s$ is a prime. In this paper, Hamilton cycles of these exceptions $X$ will be found.</description>

      <title>MetaGraphLoc: A Graph-based Meta-learning Scheme for Indoor Localization via Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate indoor localization remains challenging due to variations in wireless signal environments and limited data availability. This paper introduces MetaGraphLoc, a novel system leveraging sensor fusion, graph neural networks (GNNs), and meta-learning to overcome these limitations. MetaGraphLoc integrates received signal strength indicator measurements with inertial measurement unit data to enhance localization accuracy. Our proposed GNN architecture, featuring dynamic edge construction (DEC), captures the spatial relationships between access points and underlying data patterns. MetaGraphLoc employs a meta-learning framework to adapt the GNN model to new environments with minimal data collection, significantly reducing calibration efforts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaGraphLoc. Data fusion reduces localization error by 15.92%, underscoring its importance. The GNN with DEC outperforms traditional deep neural networks by up to 30.89%, considering accuracy. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach enables efficient adaptation to new environments, minimizing data collection requirements. These advancements position MetaGraphLoc as a promising solution for indoor localization, paving the way for improved navigation and location-based services in the ever-evolving Internet of Things networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource Optimization, Computation Offloading and Resource Slicing for Multi-Edge Traffic-Cognitive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolving landscape of edge computing envisions platforms operating as dynamic intermediaries between application providers and edge servers (ESs), where task offloading is coupled with payments for computational services. Ensuring efficient resource utilization and meeting stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements necessitates incentivizing ESs while optimizing the platforms operational objectives. This paper investigates a multi-agent system where both the platform and ESs are self-interested entities, addressing the joint optimization of revenue maximization, resource allocation, and task offloading. We propose a novel Stackelberg game-based framework to model interactions between stakeholders and solve the optimization problem using a Bayesian Optimization-based centralized algorithm. Recognizing practical challenges in information collection due to privacy concerns, we further design a decentralized solution leveraging neural network optimization and a privacy-preserving information exchange protocol. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>KACDP: A Highly Interpretable Credit Default Prediction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of finance, the prediction of individual credit default is of vital importance. However, existing methods face problems such as insufficient interpretability and transparency as well as limited performance when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear data. To address these issues, this paper introduces a method based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs is a new type of neural network architecture with learnable activation functions and no linear weights, which has potential advantages in handling complex multi-dimensional data. Specifically, this paper applies KANs to the field of individual credit risk prediction for the first time and constructs the Kolmogorov-Arnold Credit Default Predict (KACDP) model. Experiments show that the KACDP model outperforms mainstream credit default prediction models in performance metrics (ROC_AUC and F1 values). Meanwhile, through methods such as feature attribution scores and visualization of the model structure, the model's decision-making process and the importance of different features are clearly demonstrated, providing transparent and interpretable decision-making basis for financial institutions and meeting the industry's strict requirements for model interpretability. In conclusion, the KACDP model constructed in this paper exhibits excellent predictive performance and satisfactory interpretability in individual credit risk prediction, providing an effective way to address the limitations of existing methods and offering a new and practical credit risk prediction tool for financial institutions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Autoencoders for Few-shot Image Generation in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to generate diverse and high-quality images for an unseen class given only a few examples in that class. However, existing methods often suffer from a trade-off between image quality and diversity while offering limited control over the attributes of newly generated images. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders (HypDAE), a novel approach that operates in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships among images and texts from seen categories. By leveraging pre-trained foundation models, HypDAE generates diverse new images for unseen categories with exceptional quality by varying semantic codes or guided by textual instructions. Most importantly, the hyperbolic representation introduces an additional degree of control over semantic diversity through the adjustment of radii within the hyperbolic disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HypDAE significantly outperforms prior methods by achieving a superior balance between quality and diversity with limited data and offers a highly controllable and interpretable generation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Decoding Makes Visual Auto-Regressive Modeling Efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of image generation, Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling has garnered considerable attention for its innovative next-scale prediction approach. This paradigm offers substantial improvements in efficiency, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. Yet, the inherently coarse-to-fine nature of VAR introduces a prolonged token sequence, leading to prohibitive memory consumption and computational redundancies. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel efficient decoding strategy tailored for the VAR framework. CoDe capitalizes on two critical observations: the substantially reduced parameter demands at larger scales and the exclusive generation patterns across different scales. Based on these insights, we partition the multi-scale inference process into a seamless collaboration between a large model and a small model. The large model serves as the 'drafter', specializing in generating low-frequency content at smaller scales, while the smaller model serves as the 'refiner', solely focusing on predicting high-frequency details at larger scales. This collaboration yields remarkable efficiency with minimal impact on quality: CoDe achieves a 1.7x speedup, slashes memory usage by around 50%, and preserves image quality with only a negligible FID increase from 1.95 to 1.98. When drafting steps are further decreased, CoDe can achieve an impressive 2.9x acceleration ratio, reaching 41 images/s at 256x256 resolution on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU, while preserving a commendable FID of 2.27. The code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/CoDe</description>

      <title>Geometric Point Attention Transformer for 3D Shape Reassembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape assembly, which aims to reassemble separate parts into a complete object, has gained significant interest in recent years. Existing methods primarily rely on networks to predict the poses of individual parts, but often fail to effectively capture the geometric interactions between the parts and their poses. In this paper, we present the Geometric Point Attention Transformer (GPAT), a network specifically designed to address the challenges of reasoning about geometric relationships. In the geometric point attention module, we integrate both global shape information and local pairwise geometric features, along with poses represented as rotation and translation vectors for each part. To enable iterative updates and dynamic reasoning, we introduce a geometric recycling scheme, where each prediction is fed into the next iteration for refinement. We evaluate our model on both the semantic and geometric assembly tasks, showing that it outperforms previous methods in absolute pose estimation, achieving accurate pose predictions and high alignment accuracy.</description>

      <title>Understanding Immune Dynamics in Liver Transplant Through Mathematical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver transplant can be a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage liver disease. With the introduction of modern immunosuppressive therapies, short-term survival has significantly improved. However, long-term survival has not substantially improved in decades. Consequently, causes of death are now more likely to be due to the toxicities and side-effects of long-term immunosuppression rather than rejection. In order to study the balance of immunosuppression and rejection, we developed the first mechanistic mathematical model of liver transplant and immune system dynamics. We determined key cells and interactions in the model using literature information; we then used sensitivity analysis to determine key pathways driving the health status of the transplanted liver. We found that dynamics related to cytotoxic T cells and IL-2, in addition to the liver itself, are key determinants of liver graft injury. This has significant implications for the use of tests to monitor patients, and therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat liver transplantation rejection. Future work to collect appropriate data and parametrize the model would be valuable in improving our understanding of the dynamics of this system. We also note that our model could be tailored to model transplant of other organs.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Monocular Depth and Pose Estimation for Endoscopy with Generative Latent Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D mapping in endoscopy enables quantitative, holistic lesion characterization within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, requiring reliable depth and pose estimation. However, endoscopy systems are monocular, and existing methods relying on synthetic datasets or complex models often lack generalizability in challenging endoscopic conditions. We propose a robust self-supervised monocular depth and pose estimation framework that incorporates a Generative Latent Bank and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The Generative Latent Bank leverages extensive depth scenes from natural images to condition the depth network, enhancing realism and robustness of depth predictions through latent feature priors. For pose estimation, we reformulate it within a VAE framework, treating pose transitions as latent variables to regularize scale, stabilize z-axis prominence, and improve x-y sensitivity. This dual refinement pipeline enables accurate depth and pose predictions, effectively addressing the GI tract's complex textures and lighting. Extensive evaluations on SimCol and EndoSLAM datasets confirm our framework's superior performance over published self-supervised methods in endoscopic depth and pose estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of cardinal sequences associated with locally Lindelof, scattered, Hausdorff P-spaces (abbreviated as LLSP spaces). We outline a method for  constructing LLSP spaces from cone systems and partial orders with specific properties.  Additionally, we establish limitations on the cardinal sequences of LLSP spaces.  Finally, we present both a necessary condition and a distinct sufficient condition  for a sequence $\langle \kappa_\alpha: \alpha &lt; \omega_2 \rangle$ to be the cardinal sequence of an LLSP space.</description>

      <title>$H^3$Fusion: Helpful, Harmless, Honest Fusion of Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment of pretrained LLMs using instruction-based datasets is critical for creating fine-tuned models that reflect human preference. A growing number of alignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling the efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful, harmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This paper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined as $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles multiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model with enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust alignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second, $H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We first freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while tuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model weights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and dynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the output response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting $H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The former penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter mediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts the fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the experts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that $H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\%$, and it provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by $13.77\%$.

      <description>arXiv:2411.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI judge systems are designed to automatically evaluate Foundation Model-powered software (i.e., FMware). Due to the intrinsic dynamic and stochastic nature of FMware, the development of AI judge systems requires a unique engineering life cycle and presents new challenges. In this paper, we discuss the challenges based on our industrial experiences in developing AI judge systems for FMware. These challenges lead to substantial time consumption, cost and inaccurate judgments. We propose a framework that tackles the challenges with the goal of improving the productivity of developing high-quality AI judge systems. Finally, we evaluate our framework with a case study on judging a commit message generation FMware. The accuracy of the judgments made by the AI judge system developed with our framework outperforms those made by the AI judge system that is developed without our framework by up to 6.2%, with a significant reduction in development effort.</description>

      <title>NEMO: Can Multimodal LLMs Identify Attribute-Modified Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made notable advances in visual understanding, yet their abilities to recognize objects modified by specific attributes remain an open question. To address this, we explore MLLMs' reasoning capabilities in object recognition, ranging from commonsense to beyond-commonsense scenarios. We introduce a novel benchmark, NEMO, which comprises 900 images of origiNal fruits and their corresponding attributE-MOdified ones; along with a set of 2,700 questions including open-, multiple-choice-, unsolvable types. We assess 26 recent open-sourced and commercial models using our benchmark. The findings highlight pronounced performance gaps in recognizing objects in NEMO and reveal distinct answer preferences across different models. Although stronger vision encoders improve performance, MLLMs still lag behind standalone vision encoders. Interestingly, scaling up the model size does not consistently yield better outcomes, as deeper analysis reveals that larger LLMs can weaken vision encoders during fine-tuning. These insights shed light on critical limitations in current MLLMs and suggest potential pathways toward developing more versatile and resilient multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Pan-protein Design Learning Enables Task-adaptive Generalization for Low-resource Enzyme Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational protein design (CPD) offers transformative potential for bioengineering, but current deep CPD models, focused on universal domains, struggle with function-specific designs. This work introduces a novel CPD paradigm tailored for functional design tasks, particularly for enzymes-a key protein class often lacking specific application efficiency. To address structural data scarcity, we present CrossDesign, a domain-adaptive framework that leverages pretrained protein language models (PPLMs). By aligning protein structures with sequences, CrossDesign transfers pretrained knowledge to structure models, overcoming the limitations of limited structural data. The framework combines autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) states in its encoder-decoder architecture, applying it to enzyme datasets and pan-proteins. Experimental results highlight CrossDesign's superior performance and robustness, especially with out-of-domain enzymes. Additionally, the model excels in fitness prediction when tested on large-scale mutation data, showcasing its stability.</description>

      <title>Scalable iterative pruning of large language and vision models using block coordinate descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning neural networks, which involves removing a fraction of their weights, can often maintain high accuracy while significantly reducing model complexity, at least up to a certain limit. We present a neural network pruning technique that builds upon the Combinatorial Brain Surgeon, but solves an optimization problem over a subset of the network weights in an iterative, block-wise manner using block coordinate descent. The iterative, block-based nature of this pruning technique, which we dub ``iterative Combinatorial Brain Surgeon'' (iCBS) allows for scalability to very large models, including large language models (LLMs), that may not be feasible with a one-shot combinatorial optimization approach. When applied to large models like Mistral and DeiT, iCBS achieves higher performance metrics at the same density levels compared to existing pruning methods such as Wanda. This demonstrates the effectiveness of this iterative, block-wise pruning method in compressing and optimizing the performance of large deep learning models, even while optimizing over only a small fraction of the weights. Moreover, our approach allows for a quality-time (or cost) tradeoff that is not available when using a one-shot pruning technique alone. The block-wise formulation of the optimization problem enables the use of hardware accelerators, potentially offsetting the increased computational costs compared to one-shot pruning methods like Wanda. In particular, the optimization problem solved for each block is quantum-amenable in that it could, in principle, be solved by a quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores as didactically as possible the fundamental principles of both classical and quantum metrology, focusing on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and how it defines the maximum precision in parameter estimation, taking into account noise and the information extracted from the data. We also conduct a detailed study of Fisher Information (both classical and quantum), showing the physical significance of this important figure of merit in metrology. We further discuss how quantum states can surpass classical limits, providing much greater precision. Examples of technological applications include the development of quantum sensors, quantum thermometers, and phase parameter estimation. Finally, we review our results on the estimation of the unknown compression parameter applied to a mode of a quantum Gaussian state.</description>

      <title>DapPep: Domain Adaptive Peptide-agnostic Learning for Universal T-cell Receptor-antigen Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying T-cell receptors (TCRs) that interact with antigenic peptides provides the technical basis for developing vaccines and immunotherapies. The emergent deep learning methods excel at learning antigen binding patterns from known TCRs but struggle with novel or sparsely represented antigens. However, binding specificity for unseen antigens or exogenous peptides is critical. We introduce a domain-adaptive peptide-agnostic learning framework DapPep for universal TCR-antigen binding affinity prediction to address this challenge. The lightweight self-attention architecture combines a pre-trained protein language model with an inner-loop self-supervised regime to enable robust TCR-peptide representations. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DapPep consistently outperforms existing tools, showcasing robust generalization capability, especially for data-scarce settings and unseen peptides. Moreover, DapPep proves effective in challenging clinical tasks such as sorting reactive T cells in tumor neoantigen therapy and identifying key positions in 3D structures.</description>

      <title>Signs as Tokens: An Autoregressive Multilingual Sign Language Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language is a visual language that encompasses all linguistic features of natural languages and serves as the primary communication method for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. While many studies have successfully adapted pretrained language models (LMs) for sign language translation (sign-to-text), drawing inspiration from its linguistic characteristics, the reverse task of sign language generation (SLG, text-to-sign) remains largely unexplored. Most existing approaches treat SLG as a visual content generation task, employing techniques such as diffusion models to produce sign videos, 2D keypoints, or 3D avatars based on text inputs, overlooking the linguistic properties of sign languages. In this work, we introduce a multilingual sign language model, Signs as Tokens (SOKE), which can generate 3D sign avatars autoregressively from text inputs using a pretrained LM. To align sign language with the LM, we develop a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. These sign tokens are integrated into the raw text vocabulary of the LM, allowing for supervised fine-tuning on sign language datasets. To facilitate multilingual SLG research, we further curate a large-scale Chinese sign language dataset, CSL-Daily, with high-quality 3D pose annotations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SOKE. The project page is available at https://2000zrl.github.io/soke/.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Calibration System with Real-time Pulsar Gating for FRB Localization using CHIME/FRB Outriggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several thousand fast radio burst (FRB) sources have been discovered using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope, as part of the CHIME/FRB project. Currently, CHIME/FRB is able to localize most FRBs to a limiting precision of several arcminutes, which can be improved to subarcminute precision for some FRB sources through offline analysis of their baseband data. This allows only the most nearby sources to be robustly associated with a host galaxy. Using three new Outrigger telescopes located at transcontinental distances from CHIME, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will improve the localization capabilities of CHIME/FRB. Together, these radio telescopes will form a wide field of view, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array that will enable FRBs discovered by CHIME/FRB to be localized to a limiting precision of ~50 milliarcseconds. The astrometric position of each FRB will be determined using calibration solutions derived from well-localized radio pulsars and compact, steady radio sources. We present an overview of the VLBI calibration system that will be employed within the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project to achieve high precision FRB localizations, which will enable studies of a large number of FRB host galaxies and local environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Fast, Hybrid Imaging Architectures for Multi-scale, Hierarchical Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two major areas of modern radio astronomy, namely, explosive astrophysical transient phenomena and observations of cosmological structures, are driving the design of aperture arrays towards large numbers of low-cost elements consisting of multiple spatial scales spanning the dimensions of individual elements, the size of stations (groupings of individual elements), and the spacing between stations. Such multi-scale, hierarchical aperture arrays require a combination of data processing architectures -- pre-correlation beamformer, generic version of FFT-based direct imager, post-correlation beamformer, and post-correlation FFT imager -- operating on different ranges of spatial scales to obtain optimal performance in imaging the entire field of view. Adopting a computational cost metric based on the number of floating point operations, its distribution over the dimensions of discovery space, namely, field of view, angular resolution, polarisation, frequency, and time is examined to determine the most efficient hybrid architectures over the parameter space of hierarchical aperture array layouts. Nominal parameters of specific upcoming and planned arrays -- the SKA at low frequencies (SKA-low), SKA-low-core, a proposed long baseline extension to SKA-low (LAMBDA-I), compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), and a lunar array (FarView-core) -- are used to determine the most optimal architecture hierarchy for each from a computational standpoint, and provide a guide for designing hybrid architectures for multi-scale aperture arrays. For large, dense-packed layouts, a FFT-based direct imager is most efficient for most cadence intervals, and for other layouts that have relatively lesser number of elements or greater sparsity in distribution, the best architecture is more sensitive to the cadence interval, which in turn is determined by the science goals.</description>

      <title>Extremal Kerr-Schild Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel ansatz, where the full black hole geometry is written as a linear in mass perturbation of the associated extremal black hole base. Contrary to its "standard" version, the corresponding "extremal Kerr-Schild form" is no longer restricted to special algebraic type spacetimes, and is applicable to numerous black hole solutions with matter, such as the charged Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetimes, black holes of $D=5$ minimal gauged supergravity, or the charged dilaton-axion rotating solutions. This ansatz is likely to find its applications in black hole perturbation theory, shed new light on the CFT description of non-extremal black holes, as well as be useful for constructing new exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic censorship in a (dual) collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic censorship in anti-de Sitter space in holographic models in which the ground state is described by a good singularity. These include supersymmetric truncations of string/M-theory, for which a positive-energy theorem holds. At the boundary, our solutions describe a boost-invariant fluid in which the temperature decreases monotonically with time. On the gravity side, they correspond to black-brane spacetimes with a receding horizon. In classical gravity, curvature invariants at the horizon grow without bound. In the full theory this regime may or may not be reached. In some cases it is avoided by a phase transition to a regular geometry. In others it is reached but the boundary hydrodynamic evolution can be continued, provided the equation of state at parametrically small energies is known. Both cases require the inclusion of finite-$N$ or finite-coupling effects.</description>

      <title>From memorization to generalization: a theoretical framework for diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate a transition from memorizing the training dataset to a non-memorization regime as the size of the training set increases. Here, we begin by introducing a mathematically precise definition of this transition in terms of a relative distance: the model is said to be in the non-memorization/`generalization' regime if the generated distribution is almost surely far from the probability distribution associated with a Gaussian kernel approximation to the training dataset, relative to the sampling distribution. Then, we develop an analytically tractable diffusion model and establish a lower bound on Kullback-Leibler divergence between the generated and sampling distribution. The model also features the transition, according to our definition in terms of the relative distance, when the training data is sampled from an isotropic Gaussian distribution. Further, our study reveals that this transition occurs when the individual distance between the generated and underlying sampling distribution begins to decrease with the addition of more training samples. This is to be contrasted with an alternative scenario, where the model's memorization performance degrades, but generalization performance doesn't improve. We also provide empirical evidence indicating that realistic diffusion models exhibit the same alignment of scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Package spar for R builds ensembles of predictive generalized linear models with high-dimensional predictors. It employs an algorithm utilizing variable screening and random projection tools to efficiently handle the computational challenges associated with large sets of predictors. The package is designed with a strong focus on extensibility. Screening and random projection techniques are implemented as S3 classes with user-friendly constructor functions, enabling users to easily integrate and develop new procedures. This design enhances the package's adaptability and makes it a powerful tool for a variety of high-dimensional applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>

      <title>Uncovering deterministic behavior of black hole IGR J17091-3624: A twin of GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nonlinear properties in accreting systems, particularly for black holes, from observation is illuminating as they are expected to be general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flows that are nonlinear. Two features associated with nonlinear systems, used commonly, are chaos, which is deterministic, and random, which is stochastic. The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems is often considered to quantify the nonlinear properties of an astrophysical system. The particular emphasis is that data is often noise-contaminated and finite. We examine the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624, whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Certain similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects are explored in literature. However, this has not been the case with their non-linear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of determinism and stochasticity both, while IGR J17091-3624 was found to be predominantly stochastic. Here, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of non-linear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects and employ methods like Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, and Correlation Integral to isolate the deterministic signatures. We have found signs of determinism in IGR J17091-3624, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system. Our findings not only shed light on the complex nature of IGR J17091-3624, but also pave the way for future research employing noise-reduction techniques to analyze non-linearity in observed dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Ionization of Low-Excitation Lines in Active Galactic Nuclei and Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) can significantly impact dense molecular clouds in galaxies, heating the interstellar medium (ISM) and altering its chemistry, ionization, and thermal properties. Their influence is particularly relevant in environments with high CR rates, such as starburst galaxies with supernova remnants or jets and outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). CRs transfer energy to the ionized phase of the ISM far from the ionization source, preventing gas cooling and driving large-scale winds. In this work, we use CLOUDY to explore the effect of CRs on nebular gas, a relatively underexplored area, mainly focused on cold molecular gas. Our models cover a broad range of density ($1 - 10^4\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$), ionization parameter ($-3.5 \leq \log U \leq -1.5$), and CR ionization rate ($10^{-16}\, \rm{s^{-1}} - 10^{-12}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$). These are compared to MUSE observations of two AGN, Centaurus A and NGC 1068, and the starburst NGC 253. We find that CR rates $\gtrsim 10^{-13}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$, typical of AGN and strong starburst galaxies, can significantly alter the thermal structure of the ionized gas by forming a deep secondary low-ionization layer beyond the photoionization-dominated region. This enhances emission from low-ionization transitions, such as [\ion{N}{ii}], [\ion{S}{ii}], and [\ion{O}{i}], affecting line-ratio diagnostics, metallicity, and ionization estimates. Unlike pure photoionization models, AGN simulations with high CR ionization rates reproduce the Seyfert loci in BPT diagrams without requiring super-solar metallicities for the narrow-line region. Additionally, star formation simulations with high CR ionization rates can explain line ratios in the LINER domain. We propose new maximum starburst boundaries for BPT diagrams to distinguish regions dominated by AGN photoionization from those that could be explained by star formation plus high CR ionization rates.</description>

Abstract: We study a new class of polyominoes, called $p$-Fibonacci polyominoes, defined using $p$-Fibonacci words. We enumerate these polyominoes by applying generating functions to capture geometric parameters such as area, semi-perimeter, and the number of inner points. Additionally, we establish bijections between Fibonacci polyominoes, binary Fibonacci words, and integer compositions with certain restrictions.</description>

      <title>New tools for studying planarity in galaxy satellite systems: Milky Way satellite planes are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept -- termed "planarity" -- which aims to quantify planar structure in galaxy satellite systems without recourse to the number or thickness of planes. We use positions and velocities from the Gaia EDR3 to measure planarity in Milky Way (MW) satellites and the extent to which planes within the MW system are kinematically supported. We show that the position vectors of the MW satellites exhibit strong planarity but the velocity vectors do not, and that kinematic coherence cannot, therefore, be confirmed from current observational data. We then apply our methodology to NewHorizon, a high-resolution cosmological simulation, to compare satellite planarity in MW-like galaxies in a {\Lambda}CDM-based model to that in the MW satellite data. We demonstrate that kinematically supported planes are common in the simulation and that the observed planarity of MW satellites is not in tension with the standard {\Lambda}CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Low-rank Adaptation-based All-Weather Removal for Autonomous Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-weather image restoration (AWIR) is crucial for reliable autonomous navigation under adverse weather conditions. AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.</description>

      <title>Localized obstructed pairs with zero superfluid stiffness from doping an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions play an important role in the pairing mechanism of strongly correlated superconductors, many of which share the layered oxide structure characteristic of the cuprate, nickelate, osmate, cobaltate, ruthenate, iridate family of high-temperature superconductors. We explore the consequences of strong magnetic interactions in a lattice model of strongly-interacting d-electrons separated by weakly-interacting p-electrons. In contrast with conventional t-J models where magnetic exchange emerges in the strong-coupling expansion of Hubbard-type models, in this framework Coulomb blockade emerges in the strong-coupling limit of spin-spin interactions. This results in an insulator at fractional filling without Hubbard interactions. Doping this correlated insulator creates localized Cooper pairs that live on the edges of a square lattice, with a d-wave form-factor. They realize the flat-band eigenfunction of the checkerboard lattice Hamiltonian, and have zero kinetic energy. We present a mean-field theory of superconductivity interpolating between this interaction-localized strong-pairing limit with d-wave Bose-Einstein condensation and a weak-pairing limit with a nodal Fermi surface gap, where the superfluid stiffness scale is controlled by the electron hopping integrals and the density, as usual. The pair wavefunction connects d-wave and s-wave molecular orbitals, so that the intra-band gap on the Fermi surface is parametrically smaller than the off-shell inter-band gap. We provide experimental predictions for this scenario of local pairing on link-orbitals, and strong incentive for ab-initio calculation of the relevant local energy scales in the strongly correlated materials tied together by the structural motif of ligands on links.</description>

      <title>Partition function estimation with a quantum coin toss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating quantum partition functions is a critical task in a variety of fields. However, the problem is classically intractable in general due to the exponential scaling of the Hamiltonian dimension $N$ in the number of particles. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm for estimating the partition function $Z_\beta$ of a generic Hamiltonian $H$ up to multiplicative error based on a quantum coin toss. The coin is defined by the probability of applying the quantum imaginary-time evolution propagator $f_\beta[H]=e^{-\beta H/{2}}$ at inverse temperature $\beta$ to the maximally mixed state, realized by a block-encoding of $f_\beta[H]$ into a unitary quantum circuit followed by a post-selection measurement. Our algorithm does not use costly subroutines such as quantum phase estimation or amplitude amplification; and the binary nature of the coin allows us to invoke tools from Bernoulli-process analysis to prove a runtime scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N/{Z_\beta})$, quadratically better than previous general-purpose algorithms using similar quantum resources. Moreover, since the coin is defined by a single observable, the method lends itself well to quantum error mitigation. We test this in practice with a proof-of-concept 9-qubit experiment, where we successfully mitigate errors through a simple noise-extrapolation procedure. Our findings offer an interesting alternative for quantum partition function estimation relevant to early-fault quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>First result for testing semiclassical gravity effect with a torsion balance</title>

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, a theoretical framework connecting quantum mechanics with classical gravity, predicts that gravity may induce measurable deviations in low-frequency mechanical systems-an intriguing hypothesis at the frontier of fundamental physics. In this study, we developed and operated an advanced optomechanical platform to investigate these effects. The system integrates an optical cavity with finesse over 350000 and a torsion pendulum with an ultra-low eigenfrequency of 0.6mHz, achieving a high mechanical Q-factor exceeding 50000. We collected data for 3 months and reached a sensitivity of 0.3urad/rtHz at the Schr\"odinger-Newton frequency of 2.5mHz where deviations from the standard quantum mechanics may occur. While no evidence supporting semiclassical gravity was found, we identify key challenges in such tests and propose new experimental approaches to advance this line of inquiry. This work demonstrates the potential of precision optomechanics to probe the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconductivity and charge-density-wave order in kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the \textit{A}V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (\textit{A}~$=$~K,~Rb,~Cs) kagome materials, superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave (CDW), constituting a new platform to study the interplay of these two orders. Despite extensive research, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains disputed, with experiments seemingly supporting different conclusions. As key aspects of the physics might lie in the intertwining of electronic orders, a better understanding of the impact of the CDW on superconductivity is crucial. In this work, we develop a phenomenological framework to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW order. In particular, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for both superconducting and CDW order parameters. Given the unclear nature of the superconducting state, we discuss general pairing symmetries with a focus on $s$-wave, $d$-wave, and pair-density-wave order parameters. Motivated by experiments, we consider the additional breaking of time-reversal or point-group symmetries of the CDW and determine in detail the consequences for the superconducting state. Our results show how the superconducting state mimics the broken symmetries of the CDW and can guide future microscopic calculations, as well as the experimental identification of the superconducting state in the \textit{A}V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Searching for compact hierarchical triple systems candidates in astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact hierarchical triple (CHT) systems, where a tertiary component orbits an inner binary, provide critical insights into stellar formation and evolution. Despite their importance, the detection of such systems, especially compact ones, remains challenging due to the complexity of their orbital dynamics and the limitations of traditional observational methods. This study aims to identify new CHT star systems among Gaia astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions by analysing the radial velocity (RV) amplitude of these systems, thereby improving our understanding of stellar hierarchies. We selected a sample of bright astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions from the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Stars catalogue. The RV peak-to-peak amplitude was used as an estimator, and we applied a new method to detect potential triple systems by comparing the RV-based semi-amplitude with the astrometric semi-amplitude. We used available binary and triple star catalogues to identify and validate candidates, with a subset confirmed through further examination of the RV and astrometric data. Our analysis resulted in the discovery of 956 CHT candidates among the orbital sources as well as another 3,115 probable close binary sources in stars with accelerated solutions. Exploring the inclination, orbital period, and eccentricity of the outer companion in these CHT systems provides strong evidence of mutual orbit alignment, as well as a preference towards moderate outer eccentricities. Our novel approach has proven effective in identifying potential triple systems thereby increasing their number in the catalogues. Our findings emphasise the importance of combined astrometric and RV data analysis in the study of multiple star systems.</description>

      <title>CityWalker: Learning Embodied Urban Navigation from Web-Scale Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating dynamic urban environments presents significant challenges for embodied agents, requiring advanced spatial reasoning and adherence to common-sense norms. Despite progress, existing visual navigation methods struggle in map-free or off-street settings, limiting the deployment of autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a scalable, data-driven approach for human-like urban navigation by training agents on thousands of hours of in-the-wild city walking and driving videos sourced from the web. We introduce a simple and scalable data processing pipeline that extracts action supervision from these videos, enabling large-scale imitation learning without costly annotations. Our model learns sophisticated navigation policies to handle diverse challenges and critical scenarios. Experimental results show that training on large-scale, diverse datasets significantly enhances navigation performance, surpassing current methods. This work shows the potential of using abundant online video data to develop robust navigation policies for embodied agents in dynamic urban settings. https://ai4ce.github.io/CityWalker/</description>

      <title>From quantum enhanced to quantum inspired Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Topological finite size effect in one-dimensional chiral symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter have been widely studied for their robustness against impurities and disorder. The broad applicability of topological materials relies on the reliable transition from idealized, mathematically perfect models to finite, real-world implementations. In this paper, we explore the effects of finite size and disorders on topological properties. We propose a new criterion for characterizing finite topological systems based on the bulk conductivity of topological edge modes. We analyze the behavior of bulk conductivity and real space topological invariants both analytically and numerically for the family of SSH models. We show that our approach offers practical insights for topology determination in contemporary intermediate scale experimental applications.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the distribution of modular inverses modulo positive integers $c$ in a large interval. We provide upper and lower bounds for their box, ball and isotropic discrepancy, thereby exhibiting some deviations from random point sets. The analysis is based, among other things, on a new bound for a triple sum of Kloosterman sums.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-based Real-time Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is an important metric that helps in condition-based maintenance. Damage data obtained from the diagnostics techniques are often noisy and the RUL estimated by calibrating the parameters of the physics-based predictive model with the damage data is less reliable. Estimating the probabilistic RUL by quantifying the uncertainty in the predictive model parameters using the noisy data increases confidence in the predicted values. Uncertainty quantification methods generate statistical samples for the model parameters, that represent the uncertainty, by evaluating the predictive model several times. The computational time for solving a physics-based predictive model is significant, which makes the statistical techniques that enable probabilistic RUL estimation to be computationally expensive. It is essential to reduce the computational time for RUL so that RUL can be estimated in a feasible time. In this work, real-time probabilistic RUL estimation is demonstrated in adhesively bonded joints using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling method and cloud-based computations. The SMC sampling method is an alternative to traditional MCMC methods, which enables generating of statical parameter samples in parallel. The parallel computational capabilities of the SMC methods are exploited by running the SMC simulation on multiple cloud calls. This approach is demonstrated by estimating fatigue RUL in the adhesively bonded joint. The accuracy of probabilistic RUL estimated by SMC is validated by comparing it with RUL estimated by the MCMC and the experimental values. The SMC simulation is run on the cloud and the computational speedup of the SMC is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Extension of Lipschitz Functions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical McShane-Whitney extension theorem for Lipschitz functions is refined by showing that for a closed subset of the domain, it remains valid for any interval of the real line. This result is also extended to the setting of locally (pointwise) Lipschitz functions. In contrast to Lipschitz and pointwise Lipschitz extensions, the construction of locally Lipschitz extensions is based on Lipschitz partitions of unity of countable open covers of the domain. Such partitions of unity are a special case of a more general result obtained by Zden\v{e}k Frol\'{\i}k. To avoid the use of Stone's theorem (paracompactness of metrizable spaces), it is given a simple direct proof of this special case of Frol\'{\i}k's result. As an application, it is shown that the locally Lipschitz functions are precisely the locally finite sums of sequences of Lipschitz functions. Also, it is obtained a natural locally Lipschitz version of one of Michael's selection theorems.</description>

      <title>Rate-Informed Discovery via Bayesian Adaptive Multifidelity Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires both accurate estimation of their performance and efficient discovery of potential failure cases. This paper introduces Bayesian adaptive multifidelity sampling (BAMS), which leverages the power of adaptive Bayesian sampling to achieve efficient discovery while simultaneously estimating the rate of adverse events. BAMS prioritizes exploration of regions with potentially low performance, leading to the identification of novel and critical scenarios that traditional methods might miss. Using real-world AV data we demonstrate that BAMS discovers 10 times as many issues as Monte Carlo (MC) and importance sampling (IS) baselines, while at the same time generating rate estimates with variances 15 and 6 times narrower than MC and IS baselines respectively.</description>

      <title>Ordered random walks and the Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy line ensemble is a random collection of continuous ordered paths that plays an important role within random matrix theory and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. The aim of this paper is to prove a universality property of the Airy line ensemble. We study growing numbers of i.i.d. continuous-time random walks which are then conditioned to stay in the same order for all time using a Doob h-transform. We consider a general class of increment distributions; a sufficient condition is the existence of an exponential moment and a log-concave density. We prove that the top particles in this system converge in an edge scaling limit to the Airy line ensemble in a regime where the number of random walks is required to grow slower than a certain power (with a non-optimal exponent 3/50) of the expected number of random walk steps. Furthermore, in a similar regime we prove that the law of large numbers and fluctuations of linear statistics agree with non-intersecting Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the same satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes (f-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>BRST Noether Theorem and Corner Charge Bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a proof of the BRST Noether 1.5th theorem, conjecture in [JHEP 10 (2024) 055], for a broad class of rank-1 BV theories including supergravity and 2-form gauge theories. The theorem asserts that the BRST Noether current of any BRST invariant gauge fixed Lagrangian decomposes on-shell into a sum of a BRST-exact term and a corner term that defines Noether charges. This extends the holographic consequences of Noether's second theorem to gauge fixed theories and, in particular, offers a universal gauge independent Lagrangian derivation of the invariance of the S-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, we show that these corner Noether charges are inherently non-integrable. To address this non-integrability, we introduce a novel charge bracket that accounts for potential symplectic flux and anomalies, providing an honest canonical representation of the asymptotic symmetry algebra. We also highlight a general origin of a BRST cocycle associated with asymptotic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Securing RIS-Aided Wireless Networks Against Full Duplex Active Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the physical layer security of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless network in the presence of full-duplex active eavesdropping. In this scenario, the RIS cooperates with the Base Station (BS) to transfer information to the intended user while an active attacker attempts to intercept the information through a wiretap channel. In addition, the attacker sends jamming signals to interfere with the legitimate user's reception of the signal and increase the eavesdropping rate. Our objective is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamformers at the BS and RIS, respectively. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose a solution that decomposes it into two disjoint beamforming design sub-problems solved iteratively using Alternating Optimization (AO) techniques. Numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of varying the number of active attacking antennas and elements of the RIS on the secrecy performance of the considered systems under the presence of jamming signals sent by the attacker. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the impact of jamming signals on physical layer security in RIS-aided wireless networks. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on RIS-aided wireless networks and highlights the need to address the effects of jamming and active eavesdropping signals in such systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid Distributed Fine-tuning of a Segmentation Model Onboard Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of Earth observation (EO) satellite data is critical for natural hazard analysis and disaster response. However, processing EO data at ground stations introduces delays due to data transmission bottlenecks and communication windows. Using segmentation models capable of near-real-time data analysis onboard satellites can therefore improve response times. This study presents a proof-of-concept using MobileSAM, a lightweight, pre-trained segmentation model, onboard Unibap iX10-100 satellite hardware. We demonstrate the segmentation of water bodies from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and integrate MobileSAM with PASEOS, an open-source Python module that simulates satellite operations. This integration allows us to evaluate MobileSAM's performance under simulated conditions of a satellite constellation. Our research investigates the potential of fine-tuning MobileSAM in a decentralised way onboard multiple satellites in rapid response to a disaster. Our findings show that MobileSAM can be rapidly fine-tuned and benefits from decentralised learning, considering the constraints imposed by the simulated orbital environment. We observe improvements in segmentation performance with minimal training data and fast fine-tuning when satellites frequently communicate model updates. This study contributes to the field of onboard AI by emphasising the benefits of decentralised learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models for rapid response scenarios. Our work builds on recent related research at a critical time; as extreme weather events increase in frequency and magnitude, rapid response with onboard data analysis is essential.</description>

      <title>SVGDreamer++: Advancing Editability and Diversity in Text-Guided SVG Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVG) synthesis has demonstrated significant potential in domains such as iconography and sketching. However, SVGs generated from existing Text-to-SVG methods often lack editability and exhibit deficiencies in visual quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method to address these limitations. To improve the diversity of output SVGs, we present a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach. VPSD addresses over-saturation issues in existing methods and enhances sample diversity. A pre-trained reward model is incorporated to re-weight vector particles, improving aesthetic appeal and enabling faster convergence. Additionally, we design a novel adaptive vector primitives control strategy, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of the number of primitives, thereby enhancing the presentation of graphic details. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. We also show that our new method supports up to six distinct vector styles, capable of generating high-quality vector assets suitable for stylized vector design and poster design.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Client Selection with Personalization for Communication Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed approach to collaboratively training machine learning models. FL requires a high level of communication between the devices and a central server, thus imposing several challenges, including communication bottlenecks and network scalability. This article introduces ACSP-FL (https://github.com/AllanMSouza/ACSP-FL), a solution to reduce the overall communication and computation costs for training a model in FL environments. ACSP-FL employs a client selection strategy that dynamically adapts the number of devices training the model and the number of rounds required to achieve convergence. Moreover, ACSP-FL enables model personalization to improve clients performance. A use case based on human activity recognition datasets aims to show the impact and benefits of ACSP-FL when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental evaluations show that ACSP-FL minimizes the overall communication and computation overheads to train a model and converges the system efficiently. In particular, ACSP-FL reduces communication up to 95% compared to literature approaches while providing good convergence even in scenarios where data is distributed differently, non-independent and identical way between client devices.</description>

      <title>Actuation of Cell Sheets in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of fibers and cells in living tissues affect their mechanical properties and functionality. In this context, one can draw an analogy between living tissues and nematic liquid crystal elastomers. We explore this analogy by growing fibroblasts to high density on 2D patterned substrates and observing the contraction of cell sheets upon detachment from the substrates. When the fibroblast sheets detach, they undergo an anisotropic contraction, with a maximum contraction along the nematic director, like nematic elastomers do during a phase transition. We first quantify this anisotropy using substrates patterned with stripes to induce uniaxial alignment, finding that the cell sheets resemble nematic elastomers with a negative Poisson ratio. Then, we apply design principles used for programming curvature in nematic elastomers to actuate 3D structures in the detached fibroblast layers, demonstrating an application of these principles. This proof of concept shows the ability to control the 3-D shape through 2-D patterning in soft cell layers, leading to promising avenues to program tissues.</description>

      <title>Arabic-Nougat: Fine-Tuning Vision Transformers for Arabic OCR and Markdown Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Arabic-Nougat, a suite of OCR models for converting Arabic book pages into structured Markdown text. Based on Meta's Nougat architecture, Arabic-Nougat includes three specialized models: arabic-small-nougat, arabic-base-nougat, and arabic-large-nougat. These models are fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset, arabic-img2md, comprising 13.7k pairs of Arabic book pages and their Markdown representations. Key contributions include the Aranizer-PBE-86k tokenizer, designed for efficient tokenization, and the use of torch.bfloat16 precision with Flash Attention 2 for optimized training and inference. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with arabic-large-nougat delivering the highest Markdown Structure Accuracy and the lowest Character Error Rate. Additionally, we release a large-scale dataset containing 1.1 billion Arabic tokens extracted from over 8,500 books using our best-performing model, providing a valuable resource for Arabic OCR research. All models, datasets, and code are open-sourced and available at https://github.com/MohamedAliRashad/arabic-nougat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero entropy locus for the Lozi maps. We first define a region $R$ in the parameter space and prove that for the parameters in $R$, the Lozi maps have the topological entropy zero. $R$ is contained in a larger region where every Lozi map has a unique period-two orbit, and that orbit is attracting. It is easy to see that the zero entropy locus cannot coincide with that larger region since it contains parameters for which the fixed point of the corresponding Lozi map has homoclinic points.</description>

      <title>OracleSage: Towards Unified Visual-Linguistic Understanding of Oracle Bone Scripts through Cross-Modal Knowledge Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oracle bone script (OBS), as China's earliest mature writing system, present significant challenges in automatic recognition due to their complex pictographic structures and divergence from modern Chinese characters. We introduce OracleSage, a novel cross-modal framework that integrates hierarchical visual understanding with graph-based semantic reasoning. Specifically, we propose (1) a Hierarchical Visual-Semantic Understanding module that enables multi-granularity feature extraction through progressive fine-tuning of LLaVA's visual backbone, (2) a Graph-based Semantic Reasoning Framework that captures relationships between visual components and semantic concepts through dynamic message passing, and (3) OracleSem, a semantically enriched OBS dataset with comprehensive pictographic and semantic annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that OracleSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language models. This research establishes a new paradigm for ancient text interpretation while providing valuable technical support for archaeological studies.</description>

      <title>Rock the KASBA: Blazingly Fast and Accurate Time Series Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data has become increasingly prevalent across numerous domains, driving a growing demand for time series machine learning techniques. Among these, time series clustering (TSCL) stands out as one of the most popular machine learning tasks. TSCL serves as a powerful exploratory analysis tool and is also employed as a preprocessing step or subroutine for various tasks, including anomaly detection, segmentation, and classification.
  The most popular TSCL algorithms are either fast (in terms of run time) but perform poorly on benchmark problems, or perform well on benchmarks but scale poorly. We present a new TSCL algorithm, the $k$-means (K) accelerated (A) Stochastic subgradient (S) Barycentre (B) Average (A) (KASBA) clustering algorithm. KASBA is a $k$-means clustering algorithm that uses the Move-Split-Merge (MSM) elastic distance at all stages of clustering, applies a randomised stochastic subgradient gradient descent to find barycentre centroids, links each stage of clustering to accelerate convergence and exploits the metric property of MSM distance to avoid a large proportion of distance calculations. It is a versatile and scalable clusterer designed for real-world TSCL applications. It allows practitioners to balance run time and clustering performance. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that KASBA produces significantly better clustering than the faster state of the art clusterers and is offers orders of magnitude improvement in run time over the most performant $k$-means alternatives.</description>

      <title>Learning Mean First Passage Time: Chemical Short-Range Order and Kinetics of Diffusive Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-timescale processes pose significant challenges in atomistic simulations, particularly for phenomena such as diffusion and phase transitions. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based computational framework, combined with a temporal difference (TD) learning method, to simulate long-timescale atomic processes of diffusive relaxation. We apply it to study the emergence of chemical short-range order (SRO) in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs/HEAs), which plays a crucial role in unlocking unique material properties, and find that the proposed method effectively maps the relationship between time, temperature, and SRO change. By accelerating both the sampling of lower-energy states and the simulation of transition kinetics, we identify the thermodynamic limit and the role of kinetic trapping in the SRO. Furthermore, learning the mean first passage time to a given, target SRO relaxation allows capturing realistic timescales in diffusive atomistic rearrangements. This method offers valuable guidelines for optimizing material processing and extends atomistic simulations to previously inaccessible timescales, facilitating the study of slow, thermally activated processes essential for understanding and engineering material properties.</description>

      <title>Basic Research, Lethal Effects: Military AI Research Funding as Enlistment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of unprecedented U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budgets, this paper examines the recent history of DoD funding for academic research in algorithmically based warfighting. We draw from a corpus of DoD grant solicitations from 2007 to 2023, focusing on those addressed to researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Considering the implications of DoD funding for academic research, the paper proceeds through three analytic sections. In the first, we offer a critical examination of the distinction between basic and applied research, showing how funding calls framed as basic research nonetheless enlist researchers in a war fighting agenda. In the second, we offer a diachronic analysis of the corpus, showing how a 'one small problem' caveat, in which affirmation of progress in military technologies is qualified by acknowledgement of outstanding problems, becomes justification for additional investments in research. We close with an analysis of DoD aspirations based on a subset of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant solicitations for the use of AI in battlefield applications. Taken together, we argue that grant solicitations work as a vehicle for the mutual enlistment of DoD funding agencies and the academic AI research community in setting research agendas. The trope of basic research in this context offers shelter from significant moral questions that military applications of one's research would raise, by obscuring the connections that implicate researchers in U.S. militarism.</description>

      <title>Defective regression models for cure rate modeling in Marshall-Olkin family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression model have a substantial impact on interpretation of treatments, genetic characteristics and other covariates in survival analysis. In many datasets, the description of censoring and survival curve reveals the presence of cure fraction on data, which leads to alternative modelling. The most common approach to introduce covariates under a parametric estimation are the cure rate models and their variations, although the use of defective distributions have introduced a more parsimonious and integrated approach. Defective distributions is given by a density function whose integration is not one after changing the domain of one the parameters. In this work, we introduce two new defective regression models for long-term survival data in the Marshall-Olkin family: the Marshall-Olkin Gompertz and the Marshall-Olkin inverse Gaussian. The estimation process is conducted using the maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference. We evaluate the asymptotic properties of the classical approach in Monte Carlo studies as well as the behavior of Bayes estimates with vague information. The application of both models under classical and Bayesian inferences is provided in an experiment of time until death from colon cancer with a dichotomous covariate. The Marshall-Olkin Gompertz regression presented the best adjustment and we present some global diagnostic and residual analysis for this proposal.</description>

      <title>Immobility of isolated swarmer cells due to local liquid depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial swarming is a complex phenomenon in which thousands of self-propelled rod-shaped cells move coherently on surfaces, providing an excellent example of active matter. However, bacterial swarming is different from most studied examples of active systems because single isolated cells do not move, while clusters do. The biophysical aspects underlying this behavior are unclear. In this work we explore the case of low local cell densities, where single cells become temporarily immobile. We show that immobility is related to local depletion of liquid. In addition, it is also associated with the state of the flagella. Specifically, the flagellar bundles at (temporarily) liquid depleted regions are completely spread-out. Our results suggest that dry models of self-propelled agents, which only consider steric alignments and neglect hydrodynamic effects, are oversimplified and are not sufficient to describe swarming bacteria.</description>

      <title>Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</description>

      <title>Density-Functionalized QM/MM Delivers Chemical Accuracy For Solvated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of QM/MM as a fully quantum mechanical theory of interacting subsystems, all treated at the level of density functional theory (DFT). For the MM subsystem, which lacks orbitals, we assign an ad hoc electron density and apply orbital-free DFT functionals to describe its quantum properties. The interaction between the QM and MM subsystems is also treated using orbital-free density functionals, accounting for Coulomb interactions, exchange, correlation, and Pauli repulsion. Consistency across QM and MM subsystems is ensured by employing data-driven, many-body MM force fields that faithfully represent DFT functionals. Applications to water-solvated systems demonstrate that this approach achieves unprecedented, very rapid convergence to chemical accuracy as the size of the QM subsystem increases. We validate the method with several pilot studies, including water bulk, water clusters (prism hexamer and pentamers), solvated glucose, a palladium aqua ion, and a wet monolayer of MoS$_2$.</description>

      <title>CAMLD: Contrast-Agnostic Medical Landmark Detection with Consistency-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anatomical landmark detection in medical images is essential for various clinical and research applications, including disease diagnosis and surgical planning. However, manual landmark annotation is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Existing deep learning (DL) methods often require large amounts of well-annotated data, which are costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce CAMLD, a novel self-supervised DL framework for anatomical landmark detection in unlabeled scans with varying contrasts by using only a single reference example. To achieve this, we employed an inter-subject landmark consistency loss with an image registration loss while introducing a 3D convolution-based contrast augmentation strategy to promote model generalization to new contrasts. Additionally, we utilize an adaptive mixed loss function to schedule the contributions of different sub-tasks for optimal outcomes. We demonstrate the proposed method with the intricate task of MRI-based 3D brain landmark detection. With comprehensive experiments on four diverse clinical and public datasets, including both T1w and T2w MRI scans at different MRI field strengths, we demonstrate that CAMLD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean radial errors (MREs) and success detection rates (SDRs). Our framework provides a robust and accurate solution for anatomical landmark detection, reducing the need for extensively annotated datasets and generalizing well across different imaging contrasts. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CAMLD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end transformer-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often capture multiple speech traits in their learned representations that are highly entangled, leading to a lack of interpretability. In this study, we propose the explainable Disentangled-Transformer, which disentangles the internal representations into sub-embeddings with explicit content and speaker traits based on varying temporal resolutions. Experimental results show that the proposed Disentangled-Transformer produces a clear speaker identity, separated from the speech content, for speaker diarization while improving ASR performance.</description>

Abstract: Recent research efforts focus on reducing the computational and memory overheads of Large Language Models (LLMs) to make them feasible on resource-constrained devices. Despite advancements in compression techniques, non-linear operators like Softmax and Layernorm remain bottlenecks due to their sensitivity to quantization. We propose SoftmAP, a software-hardware co-design methodology that implements an integer-only low-precision Softmax using In-Memory Compute (IMC) hardware. Our method achieves up to three orders of magnitude improvement in the energy-delay product compared to A100 and RTX3090 GPUs, making LLMs more deployable without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>Singularity with and without disorder at AKLT points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) point of the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain is a cornerstone example of a disorder point where short-range correlations become incommensurate, and correlation lengths and momenta are non-analytic. While the presence of singularities appears to be generic for AKLT points, we show that for a family of SU(N) models, the AKLT point is not a disorder point: It occurs entirely within an incommensurate phase yet the wave vector remains singular on both sides of the AKLT point. We conjecture that this new possibility is generic for models where the representation is not self-conjugate and the transfer matrix non-Hermitian, while for self-conjugate representations the AKLT points remain disorder points.</description>

      <title>GNN 101: Visual Learning of Graph Neural Networks in Your Web Browser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various applications. However, their complex structures and inner workings can be challenging for non-AI experts to understand. To address this issue, we present \name, an educational visualization tool for interactive learning of GNNs. GNN 101 seamlessly integrates mathematical formulas with visualizations via multiple levels of abstraction, including a model overview, layer operations, and detailed animations for matrix calculations. Users can easily switch between two complementary views: a node-link view that offers an intuitive understanding of the graph data, and a matrix view that provides a space-efficient and comprehensive overview of all features and their transformations across layers. GNN 101 not only demystifies GNN computations in an engaging and intuitive way but also effectively illustrates what a GNN learns about graph nodes at each layer. To ensure broad educational access, GNN 101 is open-source and available directly in web browsers without requiring any installations.</description>

      <title>Reliability of deep learning models for anatomical landmark detection: The role of inter-rater variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection of anatomical landmarks plays a crucial role in many diagnostic and surgical applications. Progresses in deep learning (DL) methods have resulted in significant performance enhancement in tasks related to anatomical landmark detection. While current research focuses on accurately localizing these landmarks in medical scans, the importance of inter-rater annotation variability in building DL models is often overlooked. Understanding how inter-rater variability impacts the performance and reliability of the resulting DL algorithms, which are crucial for clinical deployment, can inform the improvement of training data construction and boost DL models' outcomes. In this paper, we conducted a thorough study of different annotation-fusion strategies to preserve inter-rater variability in DL models for anatomical landmark detection, aiming to boost the performance and reliability of the resulting algorithms. Additionally, we explored the characteristics and reliability of four metrics, including a novel Weighted Coordinate Variance metric to quantify landmark detection uncertainty/inter-rater variability. Our research highlights the crucial connection between inter-rater variability, DL-models performances, and uncertainty, revealing how different approaches for multi-rater landmark annotation fusion can influence these factors.</description>

      <title>The VELOCE modulation zoo II. Humps and splitting patterns in spectral lines of classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line splitting in spectral lines is observed in various types of stars due to phenomena such as shocks, spectroscopic binaries, magnetic fields, spots, and non-radial modes. In pulsating stars, line splitting is often attributed to pulsation-induced shocks. However, this is rarely observed in classical Cepheids, with only a few reports, including X Sagittarii and BG Crucis, where it has been linked to atmospheric shocks. We investigate line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru using spectroscopic time series, and search for similar phenomena in other classical Cepheids. High signal-to-noise cross-correlation function (CCF) time series from the VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) project are analyzed. This dataset spans several years, allowing us to study the periodicities and evolution of CCF features. For X Sgr and BG Cru, we perform a detailed analysis of the individual components of the split CCFs. Additionally, we search for periodicities in CCF variations and examine other classical Cepheids for distortions resembling unresolved line splitting. We confirm line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru, trace the features over time, and uncover the periodicity behind them. Several other Cepheids also exhibit CCF humps, suggesting unresolved or marginally resolved line splitting. We discuss the incidence and characteristics of these stars. The periodicity of line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru differs significantly from the dominant pulsation period, ruling out pulsation-induced shocks. The periodicities are too short for rotation-related phenomena, suggesting non-radial modes as the most likely explanation, though their exact nature remains unknown. We also identify humps in six additional stars, indicating an incidence rate of 3% in the VELOCE sample.</description>

      <title>"Nuclear thermometers" reveal the origin of the universal r-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resembling behaviour of giant dipole resonances built on ground and excited states supports the validity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis and assigns giant dipole resonances as spectroscopic probes -- or ``nuclear thermometers'' -- to explore the cooling of the kilonova ejecta in neutron-star mergers down to the production of heavy elements beyond iron through the rapid-neutron capture or r-process. In previous work, we found a slight energy increase in the giant dipole resonance built on excited states at the typical temperatures of $1.0\gtrapprox T\gtrapprox0.7$ MeV where seed nuclei are produced, before ongoing neutron capture. Crucial data are presented here supporting an enhanced symmetry energy at $T=0.51$ MeV (or $5.9\times 10^9$ K) -- where the r-process occurs -- that lowers the binding energy in the Bethe-Weizs\"acker semi-empirical mass formula and results in the close in of the neutron drip line. Ergo, providing an origin to the universality of elemental abundances by limiting the reaction network for r-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced symmetry energy away from the ground state is further supported by shell-model calculations of the nuclear electric dipole ({\sc E1}) polarizability -- inversely proportional to the symmetry energy -- as a result of the destructive contribution of the products of off-diagonal {\sc E1} matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Signatures of warm dark matter in the cosmological density fields extracted using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to construct a machine-learning approach that allows for a pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) density field for various warm dark matter (WDM) models using the Lyman-alpha forest. With this regression machinery, we constrain the mass of a potential WDM particle from observed Lyman-alpha sightlines directly from the density field. We design and train a Bayesian neural network on the supervised regression task of recovering the optical depth-weighted density field $\Delta_\tau$ as well as its reconstruction uncertainty from the Lyman-alpha forest flux field. We utilise the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite at $4.1\leq z \leq 5.0$ as the main training and validation dataset. Leveraging the density field recovered by our neural network, we construct an inference pipeline to constrain the WDM particle masses based on the probability distribution function of the density fields. We find that our trained Bayesian neural network can accurately recover within a $1\sigma$ error $\geq 85\%$ of the density field pixels from a validation simulated dataset that encompasses multiple WDM and thermal models of the IGM. When predicting on Lyman-alpha skewers generated using the alternative hydrodynamical code Nyx not included in the training data, we find a $1\sigma$ accuracy rate $\geq 75\%$. We consider 2 samples of observed Lyman-alpha spectra from the UVES and GHOST instruments, at $z=4.4$ and $z=4.9$ respectively and fit the density fields recovered by our Bayesian neural network to constrain WDM masses. We find lower bounds on the WDM particle mass of $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} \geq 3.8$ KeV and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} \geq 2.2$ KeV at $2\sigma$ confidence, respectively. We are able to match current state-of-the-art WDM particle mass constraints using up to 40 times less observational data than Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques based on the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic charging of open quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the adiabatic charging of a three-level QBs, using the adiabatic quantum master equation formalism. We restrict ourselves to the weak-coupling regime with an Ohmic thermal bath and investigate the effects of relaxation and dephasing on the charging process. We analyze the dependence of the stored energy, ergotropy as well as efficiency of QB on the total time of evolution $t_f$. We demonstrate that for very short charging time ($t_f$), where the evolution is highly non-adiabatic, the stored energy and ergotropy are very small. However, with increasing $t_f$ we show that there is an optimal charging time, $t_f^{opt}$, for maximum energy charging such that at low temperatures we could fully charge the battery and effectively extract the whole amount of energy from it. Note that, the optimal charging time could be decreased by adjusting strength of the coupling between system and environment and also appropriate choice of the Hamiltonian parameters which in turn speed up the charging process. On the other hand, we show that for very long charing time $t_f$ the charging energy, ergotropy and efficiency decrease due to thermal excitations. Furthermore to get more insights about the problem we investigate the distance between density matrix of system at optimal charging time $t_f^{opt}$ and the corresponding thermal state using one-norm distance.</description>

      <title>"Give me the code" -- Log Analysis of First-Year CS Students' Interactions With GPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard in computer science (CS) education is expected to be profound. Students now have the power to generate code solutions for a wide array of programming assignments. For first-year students, this may be particularly problematic since the foundational skills are still in development and an over-reliance on generative AI tools can hinder their ability to grasp essential programming concepts. This paper analyzes the prompts used by 69 freshmen undergraduate students to solve a certain programming problem within a project assignment, without giving them prior prompt training. We also present the rules of the exercise that motivated the prompts, designed to foster critical thinking skills during the interaction. Despite using unsophisticated prompting techniques, our findings suggest that the majority of students successfully leveraged GPT, incorporating the suggested solutions into their projects. Additionally, half of the students demonstrated the ability to exercise judgment in selecting from multiple GPT-generated solutions, showcasing the development of their critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated code.</description>

      <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Quantum Circuits for Proton Affinity Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key step in interpreting gas-phase ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry (IM-MS) data for unknown structure prediction involves identifying the most favorable protonated structure. In the gas phase, the site of protonation is determined using proton affinity (PA) measurements. Currently, mass spectrometry and ab initio computation methods are widely used to evaluate PA; however, both methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient methods to estimate PA, enabling the rapid identification of the most favorable protonation site in complex organic molecules with multiple proton binding sites. In this work, we developed a fast and accurate method for PA prediction by using multiple descriptors in combination with machine learning (ML) models. Using a comprehensive set of 186 descriptors, our model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R2 of 0.96 and a MAE of 2.47kcal/mol, comparable to experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, we designed quantum circuits as feature encoders for a classical neural network. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid quantum-classical model, we compared its performance with traditional ML models using a reduced feature set derived from the full set. The result showed that this hybrid model achieved consistent performance comparable to traditional ML models with the same reduced feature set on both a noiseless simulator and real quantum hardware, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning for accurate and efficient PA predictions.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Bandwidth Measurements from 23 Pulsars from the AO327 Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pulsar's scintillation bandwidth is inversely proportional to the scattering delay, making accurate measurements of scintillation bandwidth critical to characterize unmitigated delays in efforts to measure low-frequency gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. In this pilot work, we searched for a subset of known pulsars within $\sim$97% of the data taken with the PUPPI instrument for the AO327 survey with the Arecibo telescope, attempting to measure the scintillation bandwidths in the dataset by fitting to the 2D autocorrelation function of their dynamic spectra. We successfully measured 38 bandwidths from 23 pulsars (six without prior literature values), finding that: almost all of the measurements are larger than the predictions from NE2001 and YMW16 (two popular galactic models); NE2001 is more consistent with our measurements than YMW16; Gaussian fits to the bandwidth are more consistent with both electron density models than Lorentzian ones; and for the 17 pulsars with prior literature values, the measurements between various sources often vary by factors of a few. The success of Gaussian fits may be due to the use of Gaussian fits to train models in previous work. The variance of literature values over time could relate to the scaling factor used to compare measurements, but also seems consistent with time-varying interstellar medium parameters. This work can be extended to the rest of AO327 to further investigate these trends, highlighting the continuing importance of large archival datasets for projects beyond their initial conception.</description>

      <title>Posterior sampling with Adaptive Gaussian Processes in Bayesian parameter identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Posterior sampling by Monte Carlo methods provides a more comprehensive solution approach to inverse problems than computing point estimates such as the maximum posterior using optimization methods, at the expense of usually requiring many more evaluations of the forward model. Replacing computationally expensive forward models by fast surrogate models is an attractive option. However, computing the simulated training data for building a sufficiently accurate surrogate model can be computationally expensive in itself, leading to the design of computer experiments problem of finding evaluation points and accuracies such that the highest accuracy is obtained given a fixed computational budget. Here, we consider a fully adaptive greedy approach to this problem. Using Gaussian process regression as surrogate, samples are drawn from the available posterior approximation while designs are incrementally defined by solving a sequence of optimization problems for evaluation accuracy and positions. The selection of training designs is tailored towards representing the posterior to be sampled as good as possible, while the interleaved sampling steps discard old inaccurate samples in favor of new, more accurate ones. Numerical results show a significant reduction of the computational effort compared to just position-adaptive and static designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is introduced to perform simultaneous sparse dimension reduction on two blocks of variables. Beyond dimension reduction, it also yields an estimator for multivariate regression with the capability to intrinsically deselect uninformative variables in both independent and dependent blocks. An algorithm is provided that leads to a straightforward implementation of the method. The benefits of simultaneous sparse dimension reduction are shown to carry through to enhanced capability to predict a set of multivariate dependent variables jointly. Both in a simulation study and in two chemometric applications, the new method outperforms its dense counterpart, as well as multivariate partial least squares.</description>

      <title>The exotic structure of the spectral $\zeta$-function for the Schr\"odinger operator with P\"oschl--Teller potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the analysis of the spectral $\zeta$-function associated with a Schr\"{o}dinger operator endowed with a P\"oschl--Teller potential. We construct the spectral $\zeta$-function using a contour integral representation and, for particular self-adjoint extensions, we perform its analytic continuation to a larger region of the complex plane. We show that the spectral $\zeta$-function in these cases can possess a very unusual and remarkable structure consisting of a series of logarithmic branch points located at every nonpositive integer value of $s$ along with infinitely many additional branch points (and finitely many simple poles) whose locations depend on the parameters of the problem. By comparing the P\"oschl--Teller potential to the classic Bessel potential, we further illustrate that perturbing a given potential by a smooth potential on a finite interval can greatly affect the meromorphic structure and branch points of the spectral $\zeta$-function in surprising ways.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Proximal Policy Optimization Learning Using Task Prediction for Solving Games with Delayed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of delayed rewards in reinforcement learning (RL). While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as a leading Policy Gradient method, its performance can degrade under delayed rewards. We introduce two key enhancements to PPO: a hybrid policy architecture that combines an offline policy (trained on expert demonstrations) with an online PPO policy, and a reward shaping mechanism using Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL). The hybrid architecture leverages offline data throughout training while maintaining PPO's theoretical guarantees. Building on the monotonic improvement framework of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), we prove that our approach ensures improvement over both the offline policy and previous iterations, with a bounded performance gap of $(2\varsigma\gamma\alpha^2)/(1-\gamma)^2$, where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\varsigma$ bounds the expected advantage. Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves the optimal policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of temporal objectives into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on an inverted pendulum and a lunar lander environments, showing improvements in both learning speed and final performance compared to standard PPO and offline-only approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring IMF Sampling Effects on Star Formation and Metallicity in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of various Initial Mass Function (IMF) sampling methods on the star formation and metal enrichment histories of Ultra-Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxy analogs. These analogs are characterized by $M_{\rm vir}\sim10^8 M_\odot$ and $M_{\ast}\lesssim10^5 M_\odot$ at $z=0$, utilizing high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with a gas particle mass resolution of $\sim63 M_\odot$. Specifically, we evaluate three IMF sampling techniques: the burst model, stochastic IMF sampling, and individual IMF sampling. Our results demonstrate that the choice of IMF sampling method critically affects stellar feedback dynamics, particularly supernova (SN) feedback, thus impacting the star formation and metallicity characteristics of UFD analogs. We find that simulations with stochastic IMF sampling yield UFD analogs with 40\% to 70\% higher stellar masses than those using the burst model, due to a less immediate suppression of star formation by SNe. The individual IMF method results in even greater stellar masses, 8\% to 58\% more than stochastic runs, as stars form individually and continuously. Star formation is most continuous with individual sampling, followed by stochastic, and least with the burst model, which shows the longest quenching periods. Furthermore, the individual sampling approach achieves higher metallicity stars, aligning well with observed values, unlike the lower metallicities (about 1 dex less) found in the burst and stochastic methods. This difference is attributed to the continuous star formation in individual sampling, where gas metallicity shaped by previous SN events is immediately reflected in stellar metallicity. These findings emphasize the essential role of choosing appropriate IMF sampling methods for accurately modeling the star formation and chemical evolution of UFD galaxies.</description>

      <title>LongKey: Keyphrase Extraction for Long Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era of information overload, manually annotating the vast and growing corpus of documents and scholarly papers is increasingly impractical. Automated keyphrase extraction addresses this challenge by identifying representative terms within texts. However, most existing methods focus on short documents (up to 512 tokens), leaving a gap in processing long-context documents. In this paper, we introduce LongKey, a novel framework for extracting keyphrases from lengthy documents, which uses an encoder-based language model to capture extended text intricacies. LongKey uses a max-pooling embedder to enhance keyphrase candidate representation. Validated on the comprehensive LDKP datasets and six diverse, unseen datasets, LongKey consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and language model-based keyphrase extraction methods. Our findings demonstrate LongKey's versatility and superior performance, marking an advancement in keyphrase extraction for varied text lengths and domains.</description>

      <title>Generative Image Layer Decomposition with Visual Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have significantly enhanced the capabilities of image editing. However, achieving precise control over image composition tasks remains a challenge. Layered representations, which allow for independent editing of image components, are essential for user-driven content creation, yet existing approaches often struggle to decompose image into plausible layers with accurately retained transparent visual effects such as shadows and reflections. We propose $\textbf{LayerDecomp}$, a generative framework for image layer decomposition which outputs photorealistic clean backgrounds and high-quality transparent foregrounds with faithfully preserved visual effects. To enable effective training, we first introduce a dataset preparation pipeline that automatically scales up simulated multi-layer data with synthesized visual effects. To further enhance real-world applicability, we supplement this simulated dataset with camera-captured images containing natural visual effects. Additionally, we propose a consistency loss which enforces the model to learn accurate representations for the transparent foreground layer when ground-truth annotations are not available. Our method achieves superior quality in layer decomposition, outperforming existing approaches in object removal and spatial editing tasks across several benchmarks and multiple user studies, unlocking various creative possibilities for layer-wise image editing.

      <title>Neutron emission from the photon-induced reactions in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraperipheral collisions are the source of various interesting phenomena based on photon-induced reactions. We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\alpha$, $\gamma$-rays in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies.
  We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which only part of photon energy $E_\gamma$ is changed into the excitation energy of the nucleus ($E_{exc} \neq E_{\gamma}$) and compare its results with outcomes of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. The role of high photon energies for small neutron multiplicities is discussed. Emission of a small number of neutrons at high photon energies seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section of four- and five-neutron emission cross sections from first principles is rather demanding. The estimated emission of charged particles such as protons, deuterons and $\alpha$ is shortly discussed and confronted with very recent ALICE data, obtained with the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter.</description>

      <title>Distributed Sign Momentum with Local Steps for Training Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training Transformer models is resource-intensive, and recent studies have shown that sign momentum is an efficient technique for training large-scale deep learning models, particularly Transformers. However, its application in distributed training or federated learning remains underexplored. This paper investigates a novel communication-efficient distributed sign momentum method with local updates. Our proposed method allows for a broad class of base optimizers for local updates, and uses sign momentum in global updates, where momentum is generated from differences accumulated during local steps. We evaluate our method on the pre-training of various GPT-2 models, and the empirical results show significant improvement compared to other distributed methods with local updates. Furthermore, by approximating the sign operator with a randomized version that acts as a continuous analog in expectation, we present an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence for one instance of the proposed method for nonconvex smooth functions.</description>

      <title>RankMap: Priority-Aware Multi-DNN Manager for Heterogeneous Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern edge data centers simultaneously handle multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), leading to significant challenges in workload management. Thus, current management systems must leverage the architectural heterogeneity of new embedded systems to efficiently handle multi-DNN workloads. This paper introduces RankMap, a priority-aware manager specifically designed for multi-DNN tasks on heterogeneous embedded devices. RankMap addresses the extensive solution space of multi-DNN mapping through stochastic space exploration combined with a performance estimator. Experimental results show that RankMap achieves x3.6 higher average throughput compared to existing methods, while preventing DNN starvation under heavy workloads and improving the prioritization of specified DNNs by x57.5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coronagraphic Instrument onboard the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is an important stepping stone towards the characterization of habitable, rocky exoplanets. In a technology demonstration phase conducted during the first 18 months of the mission (expected to launch in late 2026), novel starlight suppression technology may enable direct imaging of a Jupiter analog in reflected light. Here we summarize the current activities of the Observation Planning working group formed as part of the Community Participation Program. This working group is responsible for target selection and observation planning of both science and calibration targets in the technology demonstration phase of the Roman Coronagraph. We will discuss the ongoing efforts to expand target and reference catalogs, and to model astrophysical targets (exoplanets and circumstellar disks) within the Coronagraph's expected sensitivity. We will also present preparatory observations of high priority targets.</description>

      <title>ReC-TTT: Contrastive Feature Reconstruction for Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable progress in deep learning (DL) showcases outstanding results in various computer vision tasks. However, adaptation to real-time variations in data distributions remains an important challenge. Test-Time Training (TTT) was proposed as an effective solution to this issue, which increases the generalization ability of trained models by adding an auxiliary task at train time and then using its loss at test time to adapt the model. Inspired by the recent achievements of contrastive representation learning in unsupervised tasks, we propose ReC-TTT, a test-time training technique that can adapt a DL model to new unseen domains by generating discriminative views of the input data. ReC-TTT uses cross-reconstruction as an auxiliary task between a frozen encoder and two trainable encoders, taking advantage of a single shared decoder. This enables, at test time, to adapt the encoders to extract features that will be correctly reconstructed by the decoder that, in this phase, is frozen on the source domain. Experimental results show that ReC-TTT achieves better results than other state-of-the-art techniques in most domain shift classification challenges.</description>

      <title>Breast Tumor Classification Using EfficientNet Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise breast cancer classification on histopathological images has the potential to greatly improve the diagnosis and patient outcome in oncology. The data imbalance problem largely stems from the inherent imbalance within medical image datasets, where certain tumor subtypes may appear much less frequently. This constitutes a considerable limitation in biased model predictions that can overlook critical but rare classes. In this work, we adopted EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) model that balances high accuracy with computational cost efficiency. To address data imbalance, we introduce an intensive data augmentation pipeline and cost-sensitive learning, improving representation and ensuring that the model does not overly favor majority classes. This approach provides the ability to learn effectively from rare tumor types, improving its robustness. Additionally, we fine-tuned the model using transfer learning, where weights in the beginning trained on a binary classification task were adopted to multi-class classification, improving the capability to detect complex patterns within the BreakHis dataset. Our results underscore significant improvements in the binary classification performance, achieving an exceptional recall increase for benign cases from 0.92 to 0.95, alongside an accuracy enhancement from 97.35 % to 98.23%. Our approach improved the performance of multi-class tasks from 91.27% with regular augmentation to 94.54% with intensive augmentation, reaching 95.04% with transfer learning. This framework demonstrated substantial gains in precision in the minority classes, such as Mucinous carcinoma and Papillary carcinoma, while maintaining high recall consistently across these critical subtypes, as further confirmed by confusion matrix analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical phase transition of a system with two coexisting competing order parameters is studied using the time-dependent-Ginzburg-Landau framework. The dynamics are induced by parameters capturing the physics of driving the system with an ultrafast laser pulse. A remarkable enhancement of the order parameter with a smaller mean-field value following the pump and the emergence of an induced metastable state is investigated through analytical and numerical studies. The effect of order parameter fluctuations on the exploration of the nonequilibrium free energy landscape reveals important information about the impact of both thermal and nonthermal fluctuations on the dynamics of the metastable state. Our results provide an interpretation of previously unexplained ultrafast experiments on superconductors with competing charge density wave order. Our formalism is relevant across broad classes of out-of-equilibrium systems beyond the condensed matter context, such as the Kibble-Zurek cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Merging high localization and TE-TM polarization degeneracy of guided waves in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization degree of freedom is an inherent feature of plane waves propagating in an isotropic homogeneous medium. The miniaturization of optical systems leads to the high localization of electromagnetic waves, but also to the loss of polarization control, namely, breaking TE-TM polarization degeneracy. In this work, we discover the near-field polarization degree of freedom for highly localized guided waves propagating along a dielectric metasurface. We demonstrate the opportunity to create a metasurface with the degenerate TE-TM polarization spectrum for the required operating wavelength and different constitutive materials. In particular, we analyze several possible implementations including silicon nitride and ceramic metasurfaces consisting of disk-shaped resonators, and evaluate the impact of substrate. Finally, we experimentally implement one of the metasurface designs and verify its broadband degenerate TE-TM polarization spectrum. The obtained results form a fundamentally new platform for the planar polarization devices utilizing the polarization degree of freedom of localized light.</description>

      <title>Line Bundle Resolutions via the Coherent-Constructible Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite collection of line bundles $\Phi$ introduced by Bondal on a smooth, projective toric variety $X$. For any coherent sheaf $F$ on $X$, we construct minimal resolutions of $F$ by line bundles in $\Phi$, up to twist, with length bounded by the dimension of $X$ and provide explicit formulae for their Betti numbers. For a toric subvariety $Y \subset X$ of codimension $k$, we give a construction of the minimal resolution of $f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ of length $k$ by line bundles in $\Phi$ and relate their Betti numbers to the topology of a stratified real torus. Additionally, we recover a (generally non-minimal) cellular resolution of $f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ constructed in Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev. Aspects of our proof run through the Coherent Constructible Correspondence, a form of homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties.</description>

      <title>A regularized continuum model for traveling waves and dispersive shocks of the granular chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on a discrete physical model describing granular crystals, whose equations of motion can be described by a system of differential difference equations (DDEs). After revisiting earlier continuum approximations, we propose a regularized continuum model variant to approximate the discrete granular crystal model through a suitable partial differential equation (PDE). We then compute, both analytically and numerically, its traveling wave and periodic traveling wave solutions, in addition to its conservation laws. Next, using the periodic solutions, we describe quantitatively various features of the dispersive shock wave (DSW) by applying Whitham modulation theory and the DSW fitting method. Finally, we perform several sets of systematic numerical simulations to compare the corresponding DSW results with the theoretical predictions and illustrate that the continuum model provides a good approximation of the underlying discrete one.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models and Topic Modeling for Toxicity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content moderation and toxicity classification represent critical tasks with significant social implications. However, studies have shown that major classification models exhibit tendencies to magnify or reduce biases and potentially overlook or disadvantage certain marginalized groups within their classification processes. Researchers suggest that the positionality of annotators influences the gold standard labels in which the models learned from propagate annotators' bias. To further investigate the impact of annotator positionality, we delve into fine-tuning BERTweet and HateBERT on the dataset while using topic-modeling strategies for content moderation. The results indicate that fine-tuning the models on specific topics results in a notable improvement in the F1 score of the models when compared to the predictions generated by other prominent classification models such as GPT-4, PerspectiveAPI, and RewireAPI. These findings further reveal that the state-of-the-art large language models exhibit significant limitations in accurately detecting and interpreting text toxicity contrasted with earlier methodologies.

      <title>Chiral eigenbases of the XX and XY quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the values of observables in chiral eigenstates of the XX quantum spin chain that were introduced in in our recent work and compare the form of the result with the respective expressions obtained in the more familiar eigenbasis of states with fixed magnetization in $z$-direction. We carry out the diagonalization of the XY spin chain in the chiral basis. We calculate the norm of the chiral XY eigenstates, and the values of the one-point functions and some neighbor two-point correlation functions. We interpret the spectrum and the particle content of the XY chain in terms of scattering states of an even number of kink and anti-kink excitations that are created over a reduced Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Development of an MKID frequency-to-pixel LED mapper for SPT-3G+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPT-3G+ is the next-generation camera for the South Pole Telescope (SPT). SPT is designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the mm/sub-mm sky. The planned focal plane consists of 34,000 microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), divided among three observing bands centered at 220, 285, and 345 GHz. Each readout line is designed to measure 800 MKIDs over a 500 MHz bandwidth, which places stringent constraints on the accuracy of the frequency placement required to limit resonator collisions that reduce the overall detector yield. To meet this constraint, we are developing a two-step process that first optically maps the resonance to a physical pixel location, and then next trims the interdigitated capacitor (IDC) to adjust the resonator frequency. We present a cryogenic LED apparatus operable at 300 mK for the optical illumination of SPT-3G+ detector arrays. We demonstrate integration of the LED controls with the GHz readout electronics (RF-ICE) to take data on an array of prototype SPT-3G+ detectors. We show that this technique is useful for characterizing defects in the resonator frequency across the detector array and will allow for improvements in the detector yield.</description>

      <title>Simplified Weak Galerkin Methods for Linear Elasticity on Nonconvex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for linear elasticity on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes, free from convexity constraints, by leveraging bubble functions as central analytical tools. The proposed method eliminates the need for stabilizers commonly used in traditional WG methods, resulting in a simplified formulation. The method is symmetric, positive definite, and straightforward to implement. Optimal-order error estimates are established for the WG approximations in the discrete $H^1$-norm, assuming sufficient smoothness of the exact solution, and in the standard $L^2$-norm under regularity assumptions for the dual problem. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed stabilizer-free WG method.</description>

      <title>GeneralizIT: A Python Solution for Generalizability Theory Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeneralizIT is a Python package designed to streamline the application of Generalizability Theory (G-Theory) in research and practice. G-Theory extends classical test theory by estimating multiple sources of error variance, providing a more flexible and detailed approach to reliability assessment. Despite its advantages, G-Theory's complexity can present a significant barrier to researchers. GeneralizIT addresses this challenge by offering an intuitive, user-friendly mechanism to calculate variance components, generalizability coefficients E*rho^2 and dependability Phi and to perform decision (D) studies. D-Studies allow users to make decisions about potential study designs and target improvements in the reliability of certain facets. The package supports both fully crossed and nested designs, enabling users to perform in-depth reliability analysis with minimal coding effort. With built-in visualization tools and detailed reporting functions, GeneralizIT empowers researchers across disciplines, such as education, psychology, healthcare, and the social sciences, to harness the power of G-Theory for robust evidence-based insights. Whether applied to small or large datasets, GeneralizIT offers an accessible and computationally efficient solution to improve measurement reliability in complex data environments.</description>

      <title>The transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays: the high-energy end of the Galactic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays (CRs) is essential to make sense of the Local cosmic ray spectrum. Several models have been proposed to account for this transition in the 0.1 - 10 $\times 10^{18}$ eV range. For instance: ankle models, where the change from a steep Galactic component to a hard extragalactic spectrum occurs in the $4-10 \times 10^{18}$ eV region, dip models, where the interactions of CR protons with the CMB producing electron-positron pairs shape the ankle, or mixed composition models, in which extragalactic CRs are composed of nuclei of various types.
  In all these scenarios, the low-energy part of the transition involves the high-energy part of the Galactic component. Therefore, any information on the Galactic component, such as maximum energy, chemical composition, and spectrum after propagation, is crucial to understanding the Galactic-extragalactic transition. We briefly review the high-energy part of the CR spectrum expected from the best potential sources of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: radial trends in star formation across different cosmological simulations in comparison with observations at $z \sim$ 0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal and external mechanisms that regulate and quench star formation (SF) in galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$ using MAGPI observations and the EAGLE, Magneticum, and IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. Using SimSpin to generate mock observations of simulated galaxies, we match detection/resolution limits in star formation rates and stellar mass, along with MAGPI observational details including the average point spread function and pixel scale. While we find a good agreement in the slope of the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) between MAGPI observations and all three simulations, the slope of the resolved SFMS does not agree within 1 $-$ 2$\sigma$. Furthermore, in radial SF trends, good agreement between observations and simulations exists only for galaxies far below the SFMS, where we capture evidence for inside-out quenching. The simulations overall agree with each other between $\sim1.5-4 \ R_{\rm e}$ but show varying central suppression within $R \sim 1.5 \ R_{\rm e}$ for galaxies on and below the SFMS, attributable to different AGN feedback prescriptions. All three simulations show similar dependencies of SF radial trends with environment. Central galaxies are subject to both internal and external mechanisms, showing increased SF suppression in the centre with increasing halo mass, indicating AGN feedback. Satellite galaxies display increasing suppression in the outskirts as halo mass increases, indicative of environmental processes. These results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved studies of galaxies; while global properties align, radial profiles reveal discrepancies between observations and simulations and their underlying physics.</description>

Abstract: The expected utility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) has been a milestone in economics, describing rational behavior by two axioms on a weak preference on lotteries on a finite set of outcomes: the Independence Axiom and the Continuity Axiom. For a weak preference fulfilling the Independence Axiom, I prove that continuity is equivalent to the existence of a set indifferent lotteries spanning a hyperplane.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Models of Black Hole Photon Rings from Low-Luminosity Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly-lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux, photon ring radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time-variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch, and Rautenbach proved that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest, and conjectured that the same remains true if the graph has less than $3n-6$ edges. We improve their result by proving that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{9}{4}n$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest. We also study weaker versions of the problem that might lead to an improvement on the bound obtained.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Crash Likelihood Prediction: A Complexity-Infused Approach Integrating Semantic, Contextual, and Driving Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting crash likelihood in complex driving environments is essential for improving traffic safety and advancing autonomous driving. Previous studies have used statistical models and deep learning to predict crashes based on semantic, contextual, or driving features, but none have examined the combined influence of these factors, termed roadway complexity in this study. This paper introduces a two-stage framework that integrates roadway complexity features for crash prediction. In the first stage, an encoder extracts hidden contextual information from these features, generating complexity-infused features. The second stage uses both original and complexity-infused features to predict crash likelihood, achieving an accuracy of 87.98% with original features alone and 90.15% with the added complexity-infused features. Ablation studies confirm that a combination of semantic, driving, and contextual features yields the best results, which emphasize their role in capturing roadway complexity. Additionally, complexity index annotations generated by Large Language Models outperform those by Amazon Mechanical Turk, highlighting the potential of automated tools for accurate, scalable crash prediction systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a parallel scan (prefix sum) algorithm in the Tensor Core Unit (TCU) model of computation. The TCU model assumes that multiplication between two square matrices of constant size $s$ is a basic operation. In the $(s^2, \ell)$-TCU model, we show that for inputs of size $n$, the algorithm has depth at most $2\lfloor \log_s (n)\rfloor$ and runs in $O(n(1 + \ell /s^2)/p + (s^2 + \ell) \log_s (n))$ time assuming $p$ tensor core units. Equivalently, the algorithm performs $O(n/s^2)$ multiplications of square matrices of size s.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a number count of disc galaxy lenses of one order of magnitude higher than the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we show that disc galaxy gravitational lensing can be used to strongly constrain the interpolating function of MOND.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of uncountable first-order structures that are homogeneous with respect to their finitely generated substructures. In many classical cases this is either well-known or follows from general facts, for example, if the language is finite and relational then ultrapowers provide arbitrarily large such sturctures. On the other hand, there are no general results saying that uncountable homogeneous structures with a given age exist. We examine the monoid of self-embeddings of a fixed countable homogeneous structure and, using abstract Fra\"iss\'e theory, we present a method of constructing an uncountable homogeneous structure, based on the amalgamation property of this monoid.</description>

      <title>HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform for Medical Imaging AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of large vision language models (LVLMs) that are trained on millions of paired image and text samples. Subsequent research efforts have demonstrated great potential of LVLMs to achieve high performance in medical imaging use cases (e.g., radiology report generation), but there remain barriers that hinder the ability to deploy these solutions broadly. These include the cost of extensive computational requirements for developing large scale models, expertise in the development of sophisticated AI models, and the difficulty in accessing substantially large, high-quality datasets that adequately represent the population in which the LVLM solution is to be deployed. The HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform addresses these barriers by providing powerful computational infrastructure, a suite of foundation models on top of which developers can fine-tune for their specific use cases, and a robust quality management system that sets a standard for evaluating fine-tuned models for deployment in clinical settings. The HOPPR Platform has access to millions of imaging studies and text reports sourced from hundreds of imaging centers from diverse populations to pretrain foundation models and enable use case-specific cohorts for fine-tuning. All data are deidentified and securely stored for HIPAA compliance. Additionally, developers can securely host models on the HOPPR platform and access them via an API to make inferences using these models within established clinical workflows. With the Medical-Grade Platform, HOPPR's mission is to expedite the deployment of LVLM solutions for medical imaging and ultimately optimize radiologist's workflows and meet the growing demands of the field.</description>

      <title>Ringdown Analysis of Rotating Black Holes in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes were recently computed in a generic effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with higher-derivative corrections. We exploit this breakthrough to perform the most complete search for signatures of new physics in black hole spectra to date. We construct a template that describes the post-merger gravitational-wave emission in comparable-mass binary black hole mergers at current detector sensitivity, notably including isospectrality breaking. The analysis of all events with detectable quasinormal-driven ringdown signatures yields no evidence of higher-derivative corrections in the spectra, and we set an upper bound $\ell \lesssim$ 35 km on the length scale of new physics. Looking ahead, our scheme enables new studies on the capabilities of future detectors to robustly search for signatures of new gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Classification of Fairness Patterns for Designing Sustainable Information Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing sustainable systems involves complex interactions between environmental resources, social impacts, and economic issues. In a constrained world, the challenge is to achieve a balanced design across those dimensions while avoiding several barriers to adoption. This paper explores the concept of fairness in sociotechnical system design, including its information system component. It is based on a reference sustainability meta-model capturing the concepts of value, assumption, regulation, metric and task. Starting from a set of published cases, different fairness patterns were identified and structured in a library enabling the application of strategies for adoption, anticipation, distributive justice, and transparency. They were generalised and documented using an existing sustainability template. An extension to the initial meta-model is also proposed to identify and reason on assumptions and barriers to reach the desired values. Finally, the validation of our work is discussed using two case studies, respectively addressing the fairness to manage the COVID-19 crisis and the medico-social follow-up of childhood.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral properties of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices: Anomalous Fermi singularities and polaron quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the exact spectral function of a single impurity repulsively interacting with a bath of fermions in one-dimensional lattices, by deriving the explicit expression of the form factor for both regular Bethe states and the irregular spin-flip state and $\eta$-pairing state, based on the exactly solvable Lieb-Wu model. While at low impurity momentum $Q\sim0$ the spectral function is dominated by two power-law Fermi singularities, at large momentum we observe that the two singularities develop into two-sided distributions and eventually become anomalous Fermi singularities at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (i.e., $Q=\pm\pi$), with the power-law tails extending towards low energy. Near the quarter filling of the Fermi bath, we also find two broad polaron peaks at large impurity momentum, collectively contributed by many excited many-body states with non-negligible form factors. Our exact results of those distinct features in one-dimensional Fermi polarons, which have no correspondences in two and three dimensions, could be readily probed in cold-atom laboratories by trapping highly imbalanced two-component fermionic atoms into one-dimensional optical lattices.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Automating grapevine LAI features estimation with UAV imagery and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leaf area index determines crop health and growth. Traditional methods for calculating it are time-consuming, destructive, costly, and limited to a scale. In this study, we automate the index estimation method using drone image data of grapevine plants and a machine learning model. Traditional feature extraction and deep learning methods are used to obtain helpful information from the data and enhance the performance of the different machine learning models employed for the leaf area index prediction. The results showed that deep learning based feature extraction is more effective than traditional methods. The new approach is a significant improvement over old methods, offering a faster, non-destructive, and cost-effective leaf area index calculation, which enhances precision agriculture practices.</description>

      <title>On the ERM Principle in Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic supervised learning involves algorithms trained on $n$ labeled examples to produce a hypothesis $h \in \mathcal{H}$ aimed at performing well on unseen examples. Meta-learning extends this by training across $n$ tasks, with $m$ examples per task, producing a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ within some meta-class $\mathbb{H}$. This setting applies to many modern problems such as in-context learning, hypernetworks, and learning-to-learn. A common method for evaluating the performance of supervised learning algorithms is through their learning curve, which depicts the expected error as a function of the number of training examples. In meta-learning, the learning curve becomes a two-dimensional learning surface, which evaluates the expected error on unseen domains for varying values of $n$ (number of tasks) and $m$ (number of training examples).
  Our findings characterize the distribution-free learning surfaces of meta-Empirical Risk Minimizers when either $m$ or $n$ tend to infinity: we show that the number of tasks must increase inversely with the desired error. In contrast, we show that the number of examples exhibits very different behavior: it satisfies a dichotomy where every meta-class conforms to one of the following conditions: (i) either $m$ must grow inversely with the error, or (ii) a \emph{finite} number of examples per task suffices for the error to vanish as $n$ goes to infinity. This finding illustrates and characterizes cases in which a small number of examples per task is sufficient for successful learning. We further refine this for positive values of $\varepsilon$ and identify for each $\varepsilon$ how many examples per task are needed to achieve an error of $\varepsilon$ in the limit as the number of tasks $n$ goes to infinity. We achieve this by developing a necessary and sufficient condition for meta-learnability using a bounded number of examples per domain.</description>

      <title>Remote Surgery with 5G or 6G: Knowledge Production and Diffusion Globally and in the German Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a comprehensive exploring of technology capability in 5G/6G TIS, explicitly focusing on the potential of remote surgery globally and in Germany. The paper's main contribution is its ability to anticipate new debates on the interplay between TIS and contexts, with particular emphasis on the national and international levels. Our findings, derived from a Bibliometrics study of industry-academic relationships, highlight crucial collaborations in Germany, positioning the country as a strategic actor in international TIS and, by extension, in applying 5G/6G technological systems to remote surgery due to its knowledge production capability. We propose policies that can stimulate interaction between smaller suppliers and larger companies, which can act as intermediaries and provide access to international markets.</description>

      <title>Pretrained LLM Adapted with LoRA as a Decision Transformer for Offline RL in Quantitative Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing effective quantitative trading strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the high risks associated with online interaction with live financial markets. Consequently, offline RL, which leverages historical market data without additional exploration, becomes essential. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle to capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in financial time series and may overfit to historical patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a Decision Transformer (DT) initialized with pre-trained GPT-2 weights and fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This architecture leverages the generalization capabilities of pre-trained language models and the efficiency of LoRA to learn effective trading policies from expert trajectories solely from historical data. Our model performs competitively with established offline RL algorithms, including Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), and Behavior Cloning (BC), as well as a baseline Decision Transformer with randomly initialized GPT-2 weights and LoRA. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively learns from expert trajectories and secures superior rewards in certain trading scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating pre-trained language models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning in offline RL for quantitative trading. Replication code for our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/syyunn/finrl-dt</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbourless Asymptotically Optimal Motion Planning with Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the performance of motion planning algorithms for high-degree-of-freedom robots usually requires reducing the cost or frequency of computationally expensive operations. Traditionally, and especially for asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planners, the most expensive operations are local motion validation and querying the nearest neighbours of a configuration.
  Recent advances have significantly reduced the cost of motion validation by using single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) parallelism to improve solution times for satisficing motion planning problems. These advances have not yet been applied to asymptotically optimal motion planning.
  This paper presents Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*), the first fully connected, informed, anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) algorithm. FCIT* exploits the radically reduced cost of edge evaluation via SIMD parallelism to build and search fully connected graphs. This removes the need for nearest-neighbours structures, which are a dominant cost for many sampling-based motion planners, and allows it to find initial solutions faster than state-of-the-art ASAO (VAMP, OMPL) and satisficing (OMPL) algorithms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset while converging towards optimal plans in an anytime manner.</description>

      <title>An adaptive two-grid preconditioner for flow in fractured porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a numerical solution of the mixed dimensional discrete fracture model with highly conductive fractures. We construct an unstructured mesh that resolves lower dimensional fractures on the grid level and use the finite element approximation to construct a discrete system with an implicit time approximation. Constructing an efficient preconditioner for the iterative method is challenging due to the high resolution of the process and high-contrast properties of fractured porous media. We propose a two-grid algorithm to construct an efficient solver for mixed-dimensional problems arising in fractured porous media and use it as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method. We use a local pointwise smoother on the fine grid and carefully design an adaptive multiscale space for coarse grid approximation based on a generalized eigenvalue problem. The construction of the basis functions is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method, where we solve local spectral problems with adaptive threshold to automatically identify the dominant modes which correspond to the very small eigenvalues. We remark that such spatial features are automatically captured through our local spectral problems, and connect these to fracture information in the global formulation of the problem. Numerical results are given for two fracture distributions with 30 and 160 fractures, demonstrating iterative convergence independent of the contrast of fracture and porous matrix permeability.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Forces in Photon-Medium Interactions Using Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines dissipative forces in photon-medium interactions through time-independent perturbation theory, with a specific focus on single Helium-4 atoms. Utilizing a Hamiltonian framework, energy corrections induced by dissipative gravitational frictional effects in low-density systems are derived and analyzed as a function of inter-atomic distance. The calculations reveal an energy correction peak at $r_1 = 0.1 nm$, followed by rapid exponential decay, highlighting the dominance of nonlinear dissipative effects at nanoscale separations. These findings emphasize the critical role of short-range interactions, governed by the de-Broglie wavelength of Helium-4, and provide a rigorous theoretical basis for understanding photon-medium interactions at quantum scales. This novel single-particle approach departs from macroscopic mean-field models, offering unique insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying energy dissipation. The results have potential implications for advancing quantum information processing, nonlinear optics, and the study of dissipative mechanisms in quantum fluids. Experimental validation of the theoretical predictions is proposed using state-of-the-art techniques in optical media, levitated nanoparticle systems, and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Repeated sampling of different individuals but the same clusters to improve precision of difference-in-differences estimators: the DISC design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the DISC (Different Individuals, Same Clusters) design, a sampling scheme that can improve the precision of difference-in-differences (DID) estimators in settings involving repeated sampling of a population at multiple time points. Although cohort designs typically lead to more efficient DID estimators relative to repeated cross-sectional (RCS) designs, they are often impractical in practice due to high rates of loss-to-follow-up, individuals leaving the risk set, or other reasons. The DISC design represents a hybrid between a cohort sampling design and a RCS sampling design, an alternative strategy in which the researcher takes a single sample of clusters, but then takes different cross-sectional samples of individuals within each cluster at two or more time points. We show that the DISC design can yield DID estimators with much higher precision relative to a RCS design, particularly if random cluster effects are present in the data-generating mechanism. For example, for a design in which 40 clusters and 25 individuals per cluster are sampled (for a total sample size of n=1,000), the variance of a commonly-used DID treatment effect estimator is 2.3 times higher in the RCS design for an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, 3.8 times higher for an ICC of 0.1, and 7.3 times higher for an ICC of 0.2.</description>

      <title>Driving Enhanced Exciton Transfer by Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model and study the processes of excitation, absorption, and transfer in various networks. The model consists of a harmonic oscillator representing a single-mode radiation field, a qubit acting as an antenna, a network through which the excitation propagates, and a qubit at the end serving as a sink. We investigate how off-resonant excitations can be optimally absorbed and transmitted through the network. Three strategies are considered: optimising network energies, adjusting the couplings between the radiation field, the antenna, and the network, or introducing and optimising driving fields at the start and end of the network. These strategies are tested on three different types of network with increasing complexity: nearest-neighbour and star configurations, and one associated with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The results show that, among the various strategies, the introduction of driving fields is the most effective, leading to a significant increase in the probability of reaching the sink in a given time. This result remains stable across networks of varying dimensionalities and types, and the driving process requires only a few parameters to be effective.</description>

      <title>Polaron effect in waveguide quantum optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the quantized mechanical motion of optically trapped atoms, arranged in proximity to a one-dimensional waveguide, on the propagation of polariton modes. Our study identifies a regime of resonant phonon-assisted mixing between lower and upper polaritons, resulting in a pronounced polaron effect. This effect is characterized by the formation of new band gaps and the appearance of weakly dispersive states within the original polariton band gap. The polaron spectrum, which can be directly probed via resonant elastic scattering, provides novel opportunities for quantum optical applications. These findings open avenues for enhanced control in state-of-the-art waveguide quantum electrodynamics experiments with cold atoms.</description>

Abstract: In this work, coalescence of phase-space holes of collision-less, one-dimensional plasmas is studied using kinetic simulation techniques. Phase-space holes are well-known Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal waves known for exhibiting coalescence, are numerically simulated and their coalescence is observed. Relations between the hole speed, potential, phase-space vorticity and phase-space depth are then obtained using the simulation data. This study involves the study of electron phase-space hole coalescence in a cylindrically wave-guided plasma. Using the recently developed phase-space hydrodynamic analogy, it is shown that the coalescence phenomena can be explored in terms of the fluid-analogous vortical nature of the phase-space holes. Coalescence occurs due to the interaction of the phase-space velocity fields associated with these phase-space vortices. Results obtained from the study describes various parametric relations between the coalesced hole characteristics and the characteristics of the colliding holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a stable reduction conjecture that extends Deligne-Mumford's stable reduction to higher dimensions and provide a simple proof that it holds in large characteristic, assuming two standard conjectures of the Minimal Model Program. As a result, we recover the Hacon-Kov\'acs theorem on the properness of the moduli stack $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{2,v,k}$ of stable surfaces of volume $v$ defined over $k=\overline{k}$, provided that $\operatorname{char}k&gt;C(v)$, a constant depending only on $v$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Variable Selection for High-Dimensional Mediation Analysis: Application to Metabolomics Data in Epidemiological Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In epidemiological research, causal models incorporating potential mediators along a pathway are crucial for understanding how exposures influence health outcomes. This work is motivated by integrated epidemiological and blood biomarker studies, investigating the relationship between long-term adherence to a Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic health, with plasma metabolomes as potential mediators. Analyzing causal mediation in such high-dimensional omics data presents substantial challenges, including complex dependencies among mediators and the need for advanced regularization or Bayesian techniques to ensure stable and interpretable estimation and selection of indirect effects. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for identifying active pathways and estimating indirect effects in the presence of high-dimensional multivariate mediators. Our approach adopts a multivariate stochastic search variable selection method, tailored for such complex mediation scenarios. Central to our method is the introduction of a set of priors for the selection: a Markov random field prior and sequential subsetting Bernoulli priors. The first prior's Markov property leverages the inherent correlations among mediators, thereby increasing power to detect mediated effects. The sequential subsetting aspect of the second prior encourages the simultaneous selection of relevant mediators and their corresponding indirect effects from the two model parts, providing a more coherent and efficient variable selection framework, specific to mediation analysis. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method provides superior power in detecting active mediating pathways. We further illustrate the practical utility of the method through its application to metabolome data from two cohort studies, highlighting its effectiveness in real data setting.</description>

      <title>Passive Deepfake Detection Across Multi-modalities: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deepfakes (DFs) have been utilized for malicious purposes, such as individual impersonation, misinformation spreading, and artists' style imitation, raising questions about ethical and security concerns. However, existing surveys have focused on accuracy performance of passive DF detection approaches for single modalities, such as image, video or audio. This comprehensive survey explores passive approaches across multiple modalities, including image, video, audio, and multi-modal domains, and extend our discussion beyond detection accuracy, including generalization, robustness, attribution, and interpretability. Additionally, we discuss threat models for passive approaches, including potential adversarial strategies and different levels of adversary knowledge and capabilities. We also highlights current challenges in DF detection, including the lack of generalization across different generative models, the need for comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation, and the limitations of existing multi-modal approaches. Finally, we propose future research directions that address these unexplored and emerging issues in the field of passive DF detection, such as adaptive learning, dynamic benchmark, holistic trustworthiness evaluation, and multi-modal detectors for talking-face video generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into vehicle navigation systems, understanding their path-planning capability is crucial. We tested three LLMs through six real-world path-planning scenarios in various settings and with various difficulties. Our experiments showed that all LLMs made numerous errors in all scenarios, revealing that they are unreliable path planners. We suggest that future work focus on implementing mechanisms for reality checks, enhancing model transparency, and developing smaller models.</description>

      <title>CrypQ: A Database Benchmark Based on Dynamic, Ever-Evolving Ethereum Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern database systems are expected to handle dynamic data whose characteristics may evolve over time. Many popular database benchmarks are limited in their ability to evaluate this dynamic aspect of the database systems. Those that use synthetic data generators often fail to capture the complexity and unpredictable nature of real data, while most real-world datasets are static and difficult to create high-volume, realistic updates for. This paper introduces CrypQ, a database benchmark leveraging dynamic, public Ethereum blockchain data. CrypQ offers a high-volume, ever-evolving dataset reflecting the unpredictable nature of a real and active cryptocurrency market. We detail CrypQ's schema, procedures for creating data snapshots and update sequences, and a suite of relevant SQL queries. As an example, we demonstrate CrypQ's utility in evaluating cost-based query optimizers on complex, evolving data distributions with real-world skewness and dependencies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Project Performance Forecasting using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of project performance metrics is crucial for successfully managing and delivering urban road reconstruction projects. Traditional methods often rely on static baseline plans and fail to consider the dynamic nature of project progress and external factors. This research proposes a machine learning-based approach to forecast project performance metrics, such as cost variance and earned value, for each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) category in an urban road reconstruction project. The proposed model utilizes time series forecasting techniques, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict future performance based on historical data and project progress. The model also incorporates external factors, such as weather patterns and resource availability, as features to enhance the accuracy of forecasts. By applying the predictive power of machine learning, the performance forecasting model enables proactive identification of potential deviations from the baseline plan, which allows project managers to take timely corrective actions. The research aims to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a case study of an urban road reconstruction project, comparing the model's forecasts with actual project performance data. The findings of this research contribute to the advancement of project management practices in the construction industry, offering a data-driven solution for improving project performance monitoring and control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic SketchRefine: Scaling In-Database Decision-Making under Uncertainty to Millions of Tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty often requires choosing packages, or bags of tuples, that collectively optimize expected outcomes while limiting risks. Processing Stochastic Package Queries (SPQs) involves solving very large optimization problems on uncertain data. Monte Carlo methods create numerous scenarios, or sample realizations of the stochastic attributes of all the tuples, and generate packages with optimal objective values across these scenarios. The number of scenarios needed for accurate approximation - and hence the size of the optimization problem when using prior methods - increases with variance in the data, and the search space of the optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of tuples in the relation. Existing solvers take hours to process SPQs on large relations containing stochastic attributes with high variance. Besides enriching the SPaQL language to capture a broader class of risk specifications, we make two fundamental contributions towards scalable SPQ processing. First, to handle high variance, we propose risk-constraint linearization (RCL), which converts SPQs into Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) whose size is independent of the number of scenarios used. Solving these ILPs gives us feasible and near-optimal packages. Second, we propose Stochastic SketchRefine, a divide and conquer framework that breaks down a large stochastic optimization problem into subproblems involving smaller subsets of tuples. Our experiments show that, together, RCL and Stochastic SketchRefine produce high-quality packages in orders of magnitude lower runtime than the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Tidally Delayed Spin-Down of Very Low Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very low-mass main-sequence stars reveal some curious trends in observed rotation period distributions that require abating the spin-down that standard rotational evolution models would otherwise imply. By dynamically coupling magnetically mediated spin-down to tidally induced spin-up from close orbiting substellar companions, we show that tides from sub-stellar companions may explain these trends. In particular, brown dwarf companions can delay the spin-down and explain the observed bimodality in rotation period distribution of old, late-type M stars. We find that tidal forces also strongly influence stellar X-ray activity evolution, so that methods of gyrochronological aging must be generalized for stars with even sub-stellar companions. We also discuss how the theoretical predictions of the spin evolution model can be used with future data to constrain the population distribution of companion orbital separations.</description>

      <title>DECODE: Domain-aware Continual Domain Expansion for Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion prediction is critical for autonomous vehicles to effectively navigate complex environments and accurately anticipate the behaviors of other traffic participants. As autonomous driving continues to evolve, the need to assimilate new and varied driving scenarios necessitates frequent model updates through retraining. To address these demands, we introduce DECODE, a novel continual learning framework that begins with a pre-trained generalized model and incrementally develops specialized models for distinct domains. Unlike existing continual learning approaches that attempt to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse scenarios, DECODE uniquely balances specialization with generalization, dynamically adjusting to real-time demands. The proposed framework leverages a hypernetwork to generate model parameters, significantly reducing storage requirements, and incorporates a normalizing flow mechanism for real-time model selection based on likelihood estimation. Furthermore, DECODE merges outputs from the most relevant specialized and generalized models using deep Bayesian uncertainty estimation techniques. This integration ensures optimal performance in familiar conditions while maintaining robustness in unfamiliar scenarios. Extensive evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the framework, achieving a notably low forgetting rate of 0.044 and an average minADE of 0.584 m, significantly surpassing traditional learning strategies and demonstrating adaptability across a wide range of driving conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group element is called generalized torsion if a finite product of its conjugates is equal to the identity. We show that in a finitely generated abelian-by-finite group, an element is generalized torsion if and only if its image in the abelianization is torsion. We also prove a quantitative version with sharp bounds to the generalized exponent of these groups. In particular, we provide many examples of finitely presentable torsion-free groups in which all elements are generalized torsion. We also discuss positive generalized identities in abelian-by-finite groups and related classes.</description>

      <title>Compositional and Interface Engineering of Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films for Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the fastest-growing photovoltaic (PV) technology in the solar cell community and have reached an efficiency close to that of commercial silicon (Si) solar cells. The organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cell is an emerging PV technology and grabbed much attention due to its low cost, high efficiency, and ease of fabrication at lower temperatures 100-200 C by solution-processed spin coating or thermal evaporation techniques. Further, we introduce a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based hole transport layer (HTL) in the p-i-n device architecture PSC. In this work, we used the mixing engineering strategy of SAM with a conjugated polyelectrolyte. We dealt with the hydrophobicity and tailored the work function of the mixed SAM based HTL. Therefore, the HTL/perovskite interface is engineered, and associated device physics is discussed. In addition, we observed the lowest dark current for specific mixed (9:1) HTL, which is a prerequisite in photodetector applications. Therefore, a detailed photodetection analysis is discussed to study the scalable photodetector device. This thesis thoroughly studies perovskite compositional and interface engineering via various optoelectronic measurements. An in-depth device physics is discussed to study the interfacial defects between the charge transport and the perovskite layers. This thesis will be helpful in exploring a new class of perovskite materials and interface modification engineering for fabricating reproducible, stable, and highly efficient hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Visual Complexity of Point Set Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the visual complexity of animated transitions between point sets. Although there exist many metrics for point set similarity, these metrics are not adequate for this purpose, as they typically treat each point separately. Instead, we propose to look at translations of entire subsets/groups of points to measure the visual complexity of a transition between two point sets. Specifically, given two labeled point sets A and B in R^d, the goal is to compute the cheapest transformation that maps all points in A to their corresponding point in B, where the translation of a group of points counts as a single operation in terms of complexity. In this paper we identify several problem dimensions involving group translations that may be relevant to various applications, and study the algorithmic complexity of the resulting problems. Specifically, we consider different restrictions on the groups that can be translated, and different optimization functions. For most of the resulting problem variants we are able to provide polynomial time algorithms, or establish that they are NP-hard. For the remaining open problems we either provide an approximation algorithm or establish the NP-hardness of a restricted version of the problem. Furthermore, our problem classification can easily be extended with additional problem dimensions giving rise to new problem variants that can be studied in future work.</description>

      <title>Kochen-Specker for many qubits and the classical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several arguments demonstrate the incompatibility between Quantum Mechanics and classical Physics. Bell's inequalities and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) arguments apply to specific non-classical states. The Kochen-Specker (KS) one, instead, is especially appealing for it applies to any state. Nevertheless, in spite of the incompatibility, quantum predictions must converge to classical ones as the macroscopic scale is approached. This convergence is known as "classical limit", and is difficult to explain within quantum formalism. In this short paper, the simplified Mermin-Peres form (two qubits) of the KS argument is extended to an arbitrary number of qubits. It is shown that quantum and classical predictions converge as the number of qubits is increases to the macroscopic scale. This way to explain the classical limit concurs with, and improves, a result previously reported for GHZ states. The demonstration for the general case (i.e., for all possible observables) that the classical limit is the consequence of merely increasing the number of particles, is important and seems to be at hand.</description>

      <title>Exploring Superpixel Segmentation Methods in the Context of Citizen Science and Deforestation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical forests play an essential role in the planet's ecosystem, making the conservation of these biomes a worldwide priority. However, ongoing deforestation and degradation pose a significant threat to their existence, necessitating effective monitoring and the proposal of actions to mitigate the damage caused by these processes. In this regard, initiatives range from government and private sector monitoring programs to solutions based on citizen science campaigns, for example. Particularly in the context of citizen science campaigns, the segmentation of remote sensing images to identify deforested areas and subsequently submit them to analysis by non-specialized volunteers is necessary. Thus, segmentation using superpixel-based techniques proves to be a viable solution for this important task. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis of 22 superpixel-based segmentation methods applied to remote sensing images, aiming to identify which of them are more suitable for generating segments for citizen science campaigns. The results reveal that seven of the segmentation methods outperformed the baseline method (SLIC) currently employed in the ForestEyes citizen science project, indicating an opportunity for improvement in this important stage of campaign development.</description>

      <title>A Measurement of the Water Abundance in the Atmosphere of the Hot Jupiter WASP-43b with High-resolution Cross-correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules has been a primary focus in studying the atmospheres of hot Jupiters, as doing so can help constrain the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The C/O ratio can help reveal the evolution and formation pathways of hot Jupiters and provide a strong understanding of the atmospheric composition. In the last decade, high-resolution spectral analyses have become increasingly useful in measuring precise abundances of several carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules. This allows for a more precise constraint of the C/O ratio. We present four transits of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b observed between 1.45 $-$ 2.45 $\mu$m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating InfraRed Spectrometer (IGRINS) on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected H$_2$O at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3.51. We tested for the presence of CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$, but we did not detect these carbon-bearing species. We ran a retrieval for all four molecules and obtained a water abundance of $\log_{10}(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = -2.24^{+0.57}_{-0.48}$. We obtained an upper limit on the C/O ratio of C/O $&lt;$ 0.95. These findings are consistent with previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>AI2T: Building Trustable AI Tutors by Interactively Teaching a Self-Aware Learning Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI2T is an interactively teachable AI for authoring intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Authors tutor AI2T by providing a few step-by-step solutions and then grading AI2T's own problem-solving attempts. From just 20-30 minutes of interactive training, AI2T can induce robust rules for step-by-step solution tracking (i.e., model-tracing). As AI2T learns it can accurately estimate its certainty of performing correctly on unseen problem steps using STAND: a self-aware precondition learning algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods like XGBoost. Our user study shows that authors can use STAND's certainty heuristic to estimate when AI2T has been trained on enough diverse problems to induce correct and complete model-tracing programs. AI2T-induced programs are more reliable than hallucination-prone LLMs and prior authoring-by-tutoring approaches. With its self-aware induction of hierarchical rules, AI2T offers a path toward trustable data-efficient authoring-by-tutoring for complex ITSs that normally require as many as 200-300 hours of programming per hour of instruction.</description>

      <title>Stability and Synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine a group of oscillators, each endowed with their own rhythm or frequency, be it the ticking of a biological clock, the swing of a pendulum, or the glowing of fireflies. While these individual oscillators may seem independent of one another at first glance, the true magic lies in their ability to influence and synchronize with one another, like a group of fireflies glowing in unison.
  The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization.
  This work aims to study the stability and synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators, starting off with an introduction to Kuramoto Oscillators and it's broader applications. We then at a graph theoretic formulation for the same and establish various criterion for the stability, synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators. Finally, we broadly analyze and experiment with various physical systems that tend to behave like Kuramoto oscillators followed by further simulations.</description>

      <title>A Practical Approach to Formal Methods: An Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Security Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop trustworthy distributed systems, verification techniques and formal methods, including lightweight and practical approaches, have been employed to certify the design or implementation of security protocols. Lightweight formal methods offer a more accessible alternative to traditional fully formalised techniques by focusing on simplified models and tool support, making them more applicable in practical settings. The technical advantages of formal verification over manual testing are increasingly recognised in the cybersecurity community. However, for practitioners, formal modelling and verification are often too complex and unfamiliar to be used routinely. In this paper, we present an Eclipse IDE for the design, verification, and implementation of security protocols and evaluate its effectiveness, including feedback from users in educational settings. It offers user-friendly assistance in the formalisation process as part of a Model-Driven Development approach. This IDE centres around the Alice &amp; Bob (AnB) notation, the AnBx Compiler and Code Generator, the OFMC model checker, and the ProVerif cryptographic protocol verifier. For the evaluation, we identify the six most prominent limiting factors for formal method adoption, based on relevant literature in this field, and we consider the IDE's effectiveness against those criteria. Additionally, we conducted a structured survey to collect feedback from university students who have used the toolkit for their projects. The findings demonstrate that this contribution is valuable as a workflow aid and helps users grasp essential cybersecurity concepts, even for those with limited knowledge of formal methods or cryptography. Crucially, users reported that the IDE has been an important component to complete their projects and that they would use again in the future, given the opportunity.</description>

      <title>Measuring Emergent Capabilities of LLMs for Software Engineering: How Far Are We?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple contexts has sparked interest in understanding how scaling model size might lead to behavioral changes, as LLMs can exhibit behaviors not observed in their smaller counterparts. Understanding these emergent capabilities is essential for advancing LLM development and improving their interpretability across diverse tasks. However, whether LLMs exhibit true emergence in the context of Software Engineering remains an unexplored topic, as most research has focused on NLP tasks. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of capabilities in the context of SE. We propose a model-agnostic pipeline for evaluating this phenomenon across three SE tasks: bug fixing, code translation, and commit message generation. More precisely, for each task, we present a case study instantiating our pipeline to analyze the emergence of capabilities in CodeGen1-multi across four scales ranging from 350M to 16.1B parameters. Our findings do not not provide evidence to support the idea of emergent capabilities resulting from scaling the model size in the selected set of tasks. We hope our results can pave the way to a more nuanced understanding of emergent capabilities of LLMs within the SE domain, guiding future research to focus on task-specific evaluations and the identification of alternative factors contributing to this phenomenon. Our work underscores the importance of task diversity in examining model behaviors and highlights potential limitations in transferring prior understandings of and approaches to emergence from NLP to Software Engineering.</description>

      <title>MapEval: Towards Unified, Robust and Efficient SLAM Map Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating massive-scale point cloud maps in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains challenging, primarily due to the absence of unified, robust and efficient evaluation frameworks. We present MapEval, an open-source framework for comprehensive quality assessment of point cloud maps, specifically addressing SLAM scenarios where ground truth map is inherently sparse compared to the mapped environment. Through systematic analysis of existing evaluation metrics in SLAM applications, we identify their fundamental limitations and establish clear guidelines for consistent map quality assessment. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel Gaussian-approximated Wasserstein distance in voxelized space, enabling two complementary metrics under the same error standard: Voxelized Average Wasserstein Distance (AWD) for global geometric accuracy and Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) for local consistency evaluation. This theoretical foundation leads to significant improvements in both robustness against noise and computational efficiency compared to conventional metrics. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that MapEval achieves at least \SI{100}{}-\SI{500}{} times faster while maintaining evaluation integrity. The MapEval library\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/JokerJohn/Cloud\_Map\_Evaluation}} will be publicly available to promote standardized map evaluation practices in the robotics community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families of smooth projective curves of genus 2 with a single point removed and study their integral points. We show that in many such families there is a dense set of fibres for which the integral points can be effectively determined. Our method is based on the construction of degree-3 \'etale covers of such curves of genus 2 and the study of the torsion values of sections of certain doubly elliptic abelian schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Web has become a worldwide platform for communication, hackers and hacktivists share their ideology and communicate with members on the "Dark Web" - the reverse of the Web. Currently, the problems of information overload and difficulty to obtain a comprehensive picture of hackers and cyber-attackers hinder the effective analysis of predicting their activities on the Web. Also, there are currently more objects connected to the internet than there are people in the world and this gap will continue to grow as more and more objects gain ability to directly interface with the Internet. Many technical communities are vigorously pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we have proposed a novel methodology for collecting and analyzing the Dark Web information to identify websites of hackers from the Web sea, and how this information can help us in predicting IoT vulnerabilities. This methodology incorporates information collection, analysis, visualization techniques, and exploits some of the IoT devices. Through this research we want to contribute to the existing literature on cyber-security that could potentially guide in both policy-making and intelligence research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present empirical evidence that neural networks with ReLU and Absolute Value activations learn distance-based representations. We independently manipulate both distance and intensity properties of internal activations in trained models, finding that both architectures are highly sensitive to small distance-based perturbations while maintaining robust performance under large intensity-based perturbations. These findings challenge the prevailing intensity-based interpretation of neural network activations and offer new insights into their learning and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Automated Test Transfer Across Android Apps Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasiveness of mobile apps in everyday life necessitates robust testing strategies to ensure quality and efficiency, especially through end-to-end usage-based tests for mobile apps' user interfaces (UIs). However, manually creating and maintaining such tests can be costly for developers. Since many apps share similar functionalities beneath diverse UIs, previous works have shown the possibility of transferring UI tests across different apps within the same domain, thereby eliminating the need for writing the tests manually. However, these methods have struggled to accommodate real-world variations, often facing limitations in scenarios where source and target apps are not very similar or fail to accurately transfer test oracles. This paper introduces an innovative technique, LLMigrate, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently transfer usage-based UI tests across mobile apps. Our experimental evaluation shows LLMigrate can achieve a 97.5% success rate in automated test transfer, reducing the manual effort required to write tests from scratch by 91.1%. This represents an improvement of 9.1% in success rate and 38.2% in effort reduction compared to the best-performing prior technique, setting a new benchmark for automated test transfer.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the light collection stability of a PEN-based wavelength shifting reflector in a tonne scale liquid argon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors rely on wavelength shifters for efficient detection of scintillation light. The current standard is tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), but it is challenging to instrument on a large scale. Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), a polyester easily manufactured as thin sheets, could simplify the coverage of large surfaces with wavelength shifters. Previous measurements have shown that commercial grades of PEN have approximately 50% light conversion efficiency relative to TPB. Encouraged by these results, we conducted a large-scale measurement using $4~m^2$ combined PEN and specular reflector foils in a two-tonne liquid argon dewar to assess its stability over approximately two weeks. This test is crucial for validating PEN as a viable substitute for TPB. The setup used for the measurement of the stability of PEN as a wavelength shifter is described, together with the first results, showing no evidence of performance deterioration over a period of 12 days.</description>

      <title>State Anxiety Biomarker Discovery: Electrooculography and Electrodermal Activity in Stress Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anxiety has become a significant health concern affecting mental and physical well-being, with state anxiety, a transient emotional response, linked to adverse cardiovascular and long-term health outcomes. This research explores the potential of non-invasive wearable technology to enhance the real-time monitoring of physiological responses associated with state anxiety. Using electrooculography (EOG) and electrodermal activity (EDA), we have reviewed novel biomarkers that reveal nuanced emotional and stress responses. Our study presents two datasets: 1) EOG signal blink identification dataset BLINKEO, containing both true blink events and motion artifacts, and 2) EOG and EDA signals dataset EMOCOLD, capturing physiological responses from a Cold Pressor Test (CPT). From analyzing blink rate variability, skin conductance peaks, and associated arousal metrics, we identified multiple new anxiety-specific biomarkers. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret and refine our model, enabling a robust understanding of the biomarkers that correlate strongly with state anxiety. These results suggest that a combined analysis of EOG and EDA data offers significant improvements in detecting real-time anxiety markers, underscoring the potential of wearables in personalized health monitoring and mental health intervention strategies. This work contributes to the development of context-sensitive models for anxiety assessment, promoting more effective applications of wearable technology in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Multi-Task Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks exhibit inherent vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, which can significantly compromise their outputs and reliability. While existing research primarily focuses on attacking single-task scenarios or indiscriminately targeting all tasks in multi-task environments, we investigate selectively targeting one task while preserving performance in others within a multi-task framework. This approach is motivated by varying security priorities among tasks in real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, where misinterpreting critical objects (e.g., signs, traffic lights) poses a greater security risk than minor depth miscalculations. Consequently, attackers may hope to target security-sensitive tasks while avoiding non-critical tasks from being compromised, thus evading being detected before compromising crucial functions. In this paper, we propose a method for the stealthy multi-task attack framework that utilizes multiple algorithms to inject imperceptible noise into the input. This novel method demonstrates remarkable efficacy in compromising the target task while simultaneously maintaining or even enhancing performance across non-targeted tasks - a criterion hitherto unexplored in the field. Additionally, we introduce an automated approach for searching the weighting factors in the loss function, further enhancing attack efficiency. Experimental results validate our framework's ability to successfully attack the target task while preserving the performance of non-targeted tasks. The automated loss function weight searching method demonstrates comparable efficacy to manual tuning, establishing a state-of-the-art multi-task attack framework.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Causal Learning for Streamflow Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamflow plays an essential role in the sustainable planning and management of national water resources. Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the proof of Ryan Unger and Christoph Kehle's work, "Gravitational collapse to extremal black holes and the third law of black hole thermodynamics", to construct examples of black hole formation from regular, one-ended asymptotically flat Cauchy data for the Einstein-Maxwell charged scalar field system in maximally-symmetric 3+1 dimensional spacetime which are exactly isometric to $dS_{4}/AdS_{4}$ Reissner N\"ordstrom black holes after a finite advanced time along the event horizon. Furthermore, the apparent horizon coincides with that of a vacuum at finite advanced time.
  This paper exists as an extension of the aforementioned work done by Unger and Kehle which disproves the "third law of black hole thermodynamics" originally posed by Hawking and Bardeen's "The Four Laws of Black Hole Mechanics". We begin with a brief introduction to the history of black hole thermodynamics, tracing the the lineage of the third law of black hole thermodynamics up to Kehle &amp; Unger's 2022 work; the basepoint for our extension to dS/AdS spacetime. We adapt the machinery from Kehle and Unger to Schwarzschild and Reissner-N\"ordstrom solutions in $dS_{4}$ and $AdS_{4}$ spacetime. Then, we study the relevant manifold gluing theory and reprove necessary gluing theorems in $dS_{4}$ and $AdS_{4}$. Finally, we provide analysis of the third law of black hole thermodynamics in these maximally symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Signal Detection in Colored Noise Using the Condition Number of $F$-Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal detection in colored noise with an unknown covariance matrix has numerous applications across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The analysis focuses on the square of the condition number \(\kappa^2(\cdot)\), defined as the ratio of the largest to smallest eigenvalue \((\lambda_{\text{max}}/\lambda_{\text{min}})\) of the whitened sample covariance matrix \(\bm{\widehat{\Psi}}\), constructed from \(p\) signal-plus-noise samples and \(n\) noise-only samples, both \(m\)-dimensional. This statistic is denoted as \(\kappa^2(\bm{\widehat{\Psi}})\). A finite-dimensional characterization of the false alarm probability for this statistic under the null and alternative hypotheses has been an open problem. Therefore, in this work, we address this by deriving the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of \(\kappa^2(\bm{\widehat{\Psi}})\) using the powerful orthogonal polynomial approach in random matrix theory. These c.d.f. expressions have been used to statistically characterize the performance of \(\kappa^2(\bm{\widehat{\Psi}})\).</description>

      <title>Changing topological type of compression bodies through cone manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generically, small deformations of cone manifold holonomy groups have wildly uncontrolled global geometry. We give a short concrete example showing that it is possible to deform complete hyperbolic metrics on a thickened genus $2$ surface to complete hyperbolic metrics on the genus two handlebody with a single unknotted cusp drilled out via cone manifolds of prescribed singular structure. In other words, there exists a method to construct smooth curves in the character variety of $ \pi_1(S_{2,0}) $ which join open sets parameterising discrete groups (quasi-conformal deformation spaces) through indiscrete groups where the indiscreteness arises in a very controlled, local, way: a cone angle increasing along a fixed singular locus.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Bayesian Active Learning with Inter-Label Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary challenge of multi-label active learning, differing it from multi-class active learning, lies in assessing the informativeness of an indefinite number of labels while also accounting for the inherited label correlation. Existing studies either require substantial computational resources to leverage correlations or fail to fully explore label dependencies. Additionally, real-world scenarios often require addressing intrinsic biases stemming from imbalanced data distributions. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label active learning strategy to address both challenges. Our method incorporates progressively updated positive and negative correlation matrices to capture co-occurrence and disjoint relationships within the label space of annotated samples, enabling a holistic assessment of uncertainty rather than treating labels as isolated elements. Furthermore, alongside diversity, our model employs ensemble pseudo labeling and beta scoring rules to address data imbalances. Extensive experiments on four realistic datasets demonstrate that our strategy consistently achieves more reliable and superior performance, compared to several established methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mathematical Programming Formulation and Algorithmic Framework for Optimal Camera Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal camera placement plays a crucial role in applications such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. Even highly abstracted versions of this problem are NP-hard due to the high-dimensional continuous domain of camera configurations (i.e., positions and orientations) and difficulties in efficiently and accurately calculating camera coverage. In this paper, we present a novel framework for optimal camera placement that uses integer programming and adaptive sampling strategies to maximize coverage, given a limited camera budget. We develop a modified maximum k-coverage formulation and two adaptive sampling strategies, Explore and Exploit (E&amp;E) and Target Uncovered Spaces (TUS), that iteratively add new camera configurations to the candidate set in order to improve the solution. E&amp;E focuses on local search around camera configurations chosen in previous iterations, whereas TUS focuses specifically on covering regions that were previously uncovered. We first conduct theoretical analysis to provide bounds on the probability of finding an optimal solution and expected sampling needs, while ensuring monotonic improvements in coverage. Then, we conduct a detailed numerical analysis over different environments. Results show that E&amp;E achieves coverage improvements of 3.3-16.0% over all baseline random sampling approaches, while maintaining manageable computational times. Meanwhile, TUS performs well in open environments and with tight camera budgets, achieving gains of 6.9-9.1% in such conditions. Compared to the baseline, our approach achieves similar coverage using only 30-70% of the sampling budget, demonstrating its computational efficiency. Through a case study, we obtain insights into optimal camera placement decisions for a typical indoor surveillance application.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Generative AI-Enhanced Content: A Conceptual Framework Using Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed-Methods Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has revolutionized content generation, offering transformative capabilities for improving language coherence, readability, and overall quality. This manuscript explores the application of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research approaches to evaluate the performance of GenAI models in enhancing scientific writing. Using a hypothetical use case involving a collaborative medical imaging manuscript, we demonstrate how each method provides unique insights into the impact of GenAI. Qualitative methods gather in-depth feedback from expert reviewers, analyzing their responses using thematic analysis tools to capture nuanced improvements and identify limitations. Quantitative approaches employ automated metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and readability scores, as well as user surveys, to objectively measure improvements in coherence, fluency, and structure. Mixed-methods research integrates these strengths, combining statistical evaluations with detailed qualitative insights to provide a comprehensive assessment. These research methods enable quantifying improvement levels in GenAI-generated content, addressing critical aspects of linguistic quality and technical accuracy. They also offer a robust framework for benchmarking GenAI tools against traditional editing processes, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of these technologies. By leveraging these methodologies, researchers can evaluate the performance boost driven by GenAI, refine its applications, and guide its responsible adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific research. This work underscores the importance of rigorous evaluation frameworks for advancing trust and innovation in GenAI.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations of non-reciprocal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems can be thought of as disobeying Newtons third law - an action does not cause an equal and opposite reaction. In recent years there has been a dramatic rise in interest towards such systems. On a fundamental level, they can be a basis of describing non-equilibrium and active states of matter, with applications ranging from physics to social sciences. However, often the first step to understanding complex nonlinear models is to linearize about the steady states. It is thus useful to develop a careful understanding of linear non-reciprocal systems, similar to our understanding of Gaussian systems in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this work we explore simplest linear non-reciprocal models with noise and spatial extent. We describe their regions of stability and show how non-reciprocity can enhance the stability of a system. We demonstrate the appearance of exceptional and critical exceptional points with the respective enhancement of fluctuations for the latter. We show how strong non-reciprocity can lead to a finite-momentum instability. Finally, we comment how non-reciprocity can be a source of colored, $1/f$ type noise.</description>

      <title>MARVEL-40M+: Multi-Level Visual Elaboration for High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Content Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D content from text prompts remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the limited size, diversity, and annotation depth of the existing datasets. To address this, we introduce MARVEL-40M+, an extensive dataset with 40 million text annotations for over 8.9 million 3D assets aggregated from seven major 3D datasets. Our contribution is a novel multi-stage annotation pipeline that integrates open-source pretrained multi-view VLMs and LLMs to automatically produce multi-level descriptions, ranging from detailed (150-200 words) to concise semantic tags (10-20 words). This structure supports both fine-grained 3D reconstruction and rapid prototyping. Furthermore, we incorporate human metadata from source datasets into our annotation pipeline to add domain-specific information in our annotation and reduce VLM hallucinations. Additionally, we develop MARVEL-FX3D, a two-stage text-to-3D pipeline. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with our annotations and use a pretrained image-to-3D network to generate 3D textured meshes within 15s. Extensive evaluations show that MARVEL-40M+ significantly outperforms existing datasets in annotation quality and linguistic diversity, achieving win rates of 72.41% by GPT-4 and 73.40% by human evaluators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher Euler-Kronecker constants of a number field $K$ are the coefficients in the Laurent series expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta function about $s=1$. These coefficients are mysterious and seem to contain a lot of arithmetic information. In this article, we study these coefficients. We prove arithmetic formulas satisfied by them and prove bounds. We generalize certain results of Ihara.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Axion Detection with Neural Networks at Ultra-Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first analysis of Dark Matter axion detection applying neural networks for the improvement of signal-to-noise ratio. The main sources of thermal noise from a typical read-out chain are simulated, constituted by resonant and amplifier noises. With this purpose, an advanced modal method employed in electromagnetic modal analysis for the design of complex microwave circuits is applied. A feedforward neural network is used for a boolean decision (there is axion or only noise), and robust results are obtained: the neural network can improve by a factor of 50 the integration time needed to reach a given signal to noise ratio. This could either significantly reduce measurement times or achieve lower sensitivities with the same exposure durations.</description>

      <title>Structural Parameterization of Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural parameterizations of two identification problems: LOCATING-DOMINATING SET and TEST COVER. In the first problem, an input is a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and an integer $k$, and one asks if there is a subset $S$ of $k$ vertices such that any two distinct vertices not in $S$ are dominated by distinct subsets of $S$. In the second problem, an input is a set of items $U$, a set of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ of $U$ called $tests$ and an integer $k$, and one asks if there is a set $S$ of at most $k$ tests such that any two items belong to distinct subsets of tests of $S$. These two problems are "identification" analogues of DOMINATING SET and SET COVER, respectively. Chakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2024] proved that both the problems admit conditional double-exponential lower bounds and matching algorithms when parameterized by treewidth of the input graph. We continue this line of investigation and consider parameters larger than treewidth, like vertex cover number and feedback edge set number. We design a nontrivial dynamic programming scheme to solve TEST COVER in "slightly super-exponential" time $2^{O(|U|\log |U|)}(|U|+|\mathcal{F}|)^{O(1)}$ in the number $|U|$ of items and LOCATING-DOMINATING SET in time $2^{O(\textsf{vc} \log \textsf{vc})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textsf{vc}$ is the vertex cover number and $n$ is the order of the graph. This shows that the lower bound results with respect to treewidth from Chakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2024] cannot be extended to vertex cover number. We also show that, parameterized by feedback edge set number, LOCATING-DOMINATING SET admits a linear kernel thereby answering an open question in [Cappelle et al., LAGOS 2021]. Finally, we show that neither LOCATING-DOMINATING SET nor TEST COVER is likely to admit a compression algorithm returning an input with a subquadratic number of bits, unless $\textsf{NP} \subseteq \textsf{coNP}/poly$.</description>

      <title>ROICtrl: Boosting Instance Control for Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language often struggles to accurately associate positional and attribute information with multiple instances, which limits current text-based visual generation models to simpler compositions featuring only a few dominant instances. To address this limitation, this work enhances diffusion models by introducing regional instance control, where each instance is governed by a bounding box paired with a free-form caption. Previous methods in this area typically rely on implicit position encoding or explicit attention masks to separate regions of interest (ROIs), resulting in either inaccurate coordinate injection or large computational overhead. Inspired by ROI-Align in object detection, we introduce a complementary operation called ROI-Unpool. Together, ROI-Align and ROI-Unpool enable explicit, efficient, and accurate ROI manipulation on high-resolution feature maps for visual generation. Building on ROI-Unpool, we propose ROICtrl, an adapter for pretrained diffusion models that enables precise regional instance control. ROICtrl is compatible with community-finetuned diffusion models, as well as with existing spatial-based add-ons (\eg, ControlNet, T2I-Adapter) and embedding-based add-ons (\eg, IP-Adapter, ED-LoRA), extending their applications to multi-instance generation. Experiments show that ROICtrl achieves superior performance in regional instance control while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrational Dynamics on Bosonic Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices, which utilize harmonic oscillator modes to encode information, are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional qubit-based quantum devices, especially for the simulation of vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. We present a framework for digital quantum simulation of vibrational dynamics under anharmonic potentials on these bosonic devices. In our approach the vibrational Hamiltonian is decomposed into solvable fragments that can be used for Hamiltonian simulation on currently available bosonic hardware. Specifically, we extended the Cartan subalgebra approach [T.C. Yen, A.F. Izmaylov, PRX Quantum 2, 040320 (2021)] -- a method for decomposing quantum Hamiltonians into solvable parts -- to bosonic operators, enabling us to construct anharmonic Hamiltonian fragments that can be efficiently diagonalized using Bogoliubov transforms. The approach is tested using a simulation of tunneling dynamics in a model two-dimensional double-well potential and calculations of vibrational eigenenergies for small molecules. Our fragmentation scheme provides a new approach for digital quantum simulations on bosonic quantum hardware for multi-mode anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for NLS equations with potential on bounded domains: Ground states and multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions for a class of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equations with potential $V$ and inhomogeneous nonlinearity $g(|u|)u=|u|^{q-2}u+\beta |u|^{p-2}u$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$. Firstly, when $2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;p\leq2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ and $\beta=-1$, under an explicit smallness assumption on $V$, we prove the existence of a global minimum solution and a high-energy solution if the mass is large enough. For this case we do not require that $\Omega$ is star-shaped, which partly solves an open problem by Bartsch et al. [Math. Ann. 390 (2024) 4813--4859]. Moreover, we find that the global minimizer also exists although the nonlinearity is $L^2$-supercritical. Secondly, when $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p=2^*$ and $\beta=1$, under the smallness and some extra assumptions on $V$, we prove the existence of a ground state and a high-energy solution if $\Omega$ is star-shaped and the mass is small enough. It seems to be new in the study of normalized ground state in the context of the Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem, even for the autonomous case of $V(x)\equiv0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work done when a system at thermal equilibrium is externally driven by a unitary control parameter leads to irreversible entropy production. The entropy produced can be thought of as a combination of coherence generation and a population mismatch between the target equilibrium state and the actually achieved final state. We experimentally explored this out-of-equilibrium process in an NMR quantum processor and studied the contribution of coherence to irreversible entropy generation. We verified a generalized Clausius inequality, which affirms that irreversible entropy production is lower-bounded.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Dynamics of Entangled Linear Polymer Melts via Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive analysis of the relaxation dynamics of entangled linear polymer melts via long-time molecular dynamics simulations of a generic bead-spring model. We study the mean-squared displacements, the autocorrelation function of the end-to-end vector, $P(t)$, the single-chain dynamic structure factor, $S(q,t)$, and the linear viscoelastic properties, especially the shear stress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$. The simulation data are compared with the theoretically expected scaling laws for different time regimes of entangled melts, and with analytical expressions that account for different relaxation mechanisms in the tube model, namely, reptation, contour length fluctuation (CLF), and constraint release (CR). CLF involves a $t^{1/4}$ scaling regime in the time-dependence of $(1-P(t))$. With increasing chain length, a gradual development of this scaling regime is observed. In the absence of CR, the tube model further predicts that at long times, the chain dynamics is governed by one central quantity, the ``surviving tube fraction'' $\mu(t)$. As a result, one expects $S(q,t) \propto G(t) \propto P(t)$ in that time regime. We test this prediction by comparing $S(q,t)$ and $G(t)$ with $P(t)$. For both quantities, proportionality with $P(t)$ is not observed, indicating that CR has an important effect on the relaxation of these two quantities. Instead, to a very good approximation, we find $G(t)\propto P(t)^{2}$ at late times, which is consistent with the dynamic tube dilation or double reptation approximations for the CR process. In addition, we calculate non-local mobility functions, which can be used in dynamic density functional theories for entangled inhomogeneous polymer blends, and discuss the effect of entanglements on the shape of these functions.</description>

      <title>Wave scattering at a rectangular junction of four waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of linear waves in two dimensions by a rectangular region at the junction of four waveguides. A solution to the frequency domain problem is obtained by exploiting reflective symmetry to reduce the full problem to sub-problems defined on one quadrant of the junction. These sub-problems are solved using the eigenfunction matching method. The solution to the problem on the full region is then recovered from the solutions to the sub-problems, and a scattering matrix for the junction is presented. Finally, the solution in the time domain is constructed as a superposition of the frequency domain solutions and visualised for a range of incident pulses and waveguide geometries.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and wave functions of toponia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a linear plus Coulomb potential and conduct a meticulous study of the mass spectrum and wave function of toponium. Our investigation reveals that, owing to the exceedingly heavy mass of the top quark, the mass splitting between singlet and triplet states, as well as within the triplet states, is negligible. Consequently, relativistic corrections can be safely disregarded in the study of toponium. As such, we present the nonrelativistic wave functions for $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave toponia and study the decays $\eta_t\to \gamma\gamma$, $\eta_t\to gg$, and $\Theta\to \ell^+\ell^-$.</description>

      <title>How chromatin interactions shed light on interpreting non-coding genomic variants: opportunities and future direc-tions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic variants, including copy number variants (CNVs) and genome-wide associa-tion study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), represent structural alterations that influence genomic diversity and disease susceptibility. While coding region variants have been extensively studied, non-coding and regulatory variants present significant challenges due to their potential impacts on gene regulation, which are often obscured by the complexity of the ge-nome. Chromatin interactions, which organize the genome spatially and regulate gene expression through enhancer-promoter contacts, predominantly occur in non-coding regions. Notably, more than 90% of enhancers, crucial for gene regulation, reside in these non-coding regions, underscor-ing their importance in interpreting the regulatory effects of CNVs and GWAS-associated SNPs. In this study, we integrate chromatin interaction data with CNV and GWAS data to uncover the functional implications of non-coding variants. By leveraging this integrated approach, we pro-vide new insights into how structural variants and disease-associated SNPs disrupt regulatory networks, advancing our understanding of genetic complexity. These findings offer potential av-enues for personalized medicine by elucidating disease mechanisms and guiding therapeutic strategies tailored to individual genomic profiles. This research underscores the critical role of chromatin interactions in revealing the regulatory consequences of non-coding variants, bridging the gap between genetic variation and phenotypic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Free Image Immunization Against Diffusion-Based Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current image immunization defense techniques against diffusion-based editing embed imperceptible noise in target images to disrupt editing models. However, these methods face scalability challenges, as they require time-consuming re-optimization for each image-taking hours for small batches. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffVax, a scalable, lightweight, and optimization-free framework for image immunization, specifically designed to prevent diffusion-based editing. Our approach enables effective generalization to unseen content, reducing computational costs and cutting immunization time from days to milliseconds-achieving a 250,000x speedup. This is achieved through a loss term that ensures the failure of editing attempts and the imperceptibility of the perturbations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our model is scalable, optimization-free, adaptable to various diffusion-based editing tools, robust against counter-attacks, and, for the first time, effectively protects video content from editing. Our code is provided in our project webpage.</description>

      <title>Durbin: Internet Outage Detection with Adaptive Passive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring Internet outages is important to allow ISPs to improve their services, users to choose providers by reliability, and governments to understand the reliability of their infrastructure. Today's active outage detection provides good accuracy with tight temporal and spatial precision (around 10 minutes and IPv4 /24 blocks), but cannot see behind firewalls or into IPv6. Systems using passive methods can see behind firewalls, but usually, relax spatial or temporal precision, reporting on whole countries or ASes at 5 minute precision, or /24 IPv4 blocks with 25 minute precision. We propose Durbin, a new approach to passive outage detection that adapts spatial and temporal precision to each network they study, thus providing good accuracy and wide coverage with the best possible spatial and temporal precision. Durbin observes data from Internet services or network telescopes. Durbin studies /24 blocks to provide fine spatial precision, and we show it provides good accuracy even for short outages (5 minutes) in 600k blocks with frequent data sources. To retain accuracy for the 400k blocks with less activity, Durbin uses a coarser temporal precision of 25 minutes. Including short outages is important: omitting short outages underestimates overall outage duration by 15%, because 5% of all blocks have at least one short outage. Finally, passive data allows Durbin to report this results for outage detection in IPv6 for 15k /48 blocks. Durbin's use of per-block adaptivity is the key to providing good accuracy and broad coverage across a diverse Internet.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Training in Low-Label Regimes with Margin-Based Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as an effective approach to train robust neural network models that are resistant to adversarial attacks, even in low-label regimes where labeled data is scarce. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised adversarial training approach that enhances both robustness and natural accuracy by generating effective adversarial examples. Our method begins by applying linear interpolation between clean and adversarial examples to create interpolated adversarial examples that cross decision boundaries by a controlled margin. This sample-aware strategy tailors adversarial examples to the characteristics of each data point, enabling the model to learn from the most informative perturbations. Additionally, we propose a global epsilon scheduling strategy that progressively adjusts the upper bound of perturbation strengths during training. The combination of these strategies allows the model to develop increasingly complex decision boundaries with better robustness and natural accuracy. Empirical evaluations show that our approach effectively enhances performance against various adversarial attacks, such as PGD and AutoAttack.</description>

      <title>Calibrating DRAMPower Model: A Runtime Perspective from Real-System HPC Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating energy demands of main memory have become a concern in modern computing architectures, particularly in large-scale systems, due to frequent access patterns, increasing data volumes, and the lack of efficient power management strategies. Accurate modeling of DRAM power consumption is essential to address this challenge and optimize energy efficiency. However, existing modeling tools that heavily rely on vendor-provided datasheet values lead to a big discrepancy between the estimation result and the real-word power consumption. In this work, we propose a calibration towards the DRAMPower model by leveraging runtime energy measurements collected from real-system experiments. Using custom memory benchmarks and runtime data from the HPC cluster, we refine key DRAM current parameters within the DRAMPower model, aligning its predictions more closely with real-world observations. Our calibration reduces the average energy estimation error to less than 5%, demonstrating substantial improvements in modeling accuracy and making the DRAMPower model a more reliable tool for power-aware system design and optimization.</description>

      <title>ESS-ReduNet: Enhancing Subspace Separability of ReduNet via Dynamic Expansion with Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ReduNet is a deep neural network model that leverages the principle of maximal coding rate \textbf{redu}ction to transform original data samples into a low-dimensional, linear discriminative feature representation. Unlike traditional deep learning frameworks, ReduNet constructs its parameters explicitly layer by layer, with each layer's parameters derived based on the features transformed from the preceding layer. Rather than directly using labels, ReduNet uses the similarity between each category's spanned subspace and the data samples for feature updates at each layer. This may lead to features being updated in the wrong direction, impairing the correct construction of network parameters and reducing the network's convergence speed. To address this issue, based on the geometric interpretation of the network parameters, this paper presents ESS-ReduNet to enhance the separability of each category's subspace by dynamically controlling the expansion of the overall spanned space of the samples. Meanwhile, label knowledge is incorporated with Bayesian inference to encourage the decoupling of subspaces. Finally, stability, as assessed by the condition number, serves as an auxiliary criterion for halting training. Experiments on the ESR, HAR, Covertype, and Gas datasets demonstrate that ESS-ReduNet achieves more than 10x improvement in convergence compared to ReduNet. Notably, on the ESR dataset, the features transformed by ESS-ReduNet achieve a 47\% improvement in SVM classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ are still absent in the quark model.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Adaptive-Rank (SLAR) Method for Linear Advection and Nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order semi-Lagrangian methods for kinetic equations have been under rapid development in the past few decades. In this work, we propose a semi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR) integrator in the finite difference framework for linear advection and nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems without dimensional splitting. The proposed method leverages the semi-Lagrangian approach to allow for significantly larger time steps while also exploiting the low-rank structure of the solution. This is achieved through cross approximation of matrices, also referred to as CUR or pseudo-skeleton approximation, where representative columns and rows are selected using specific strategies. To maintain numerical stability and ensure local mass conservation, we apply singular value truncation and a mass-conservative projection following the cross approximation of the updated solution. The computational complexity of our method scales linearly with the mesh size $N$ per dimension, compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of traditional full-rank methods per time step. The algorithm is extended to handle nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems using a Runge-Kutta exponential integrator. Moreover, we evolve the macroscopic conservation laws for charge densities implicitly, enabling the use of large time steps that align with the semi-Lagrangian solver. We also perform a mass-conservative correction to ensure that the adaptive rank solution preserves macroscopic charge density conservation. To validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, we conduct a series of benchmark tests on both linear advection and nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems. The propose algorithm will have the potential in overcoming the curse of dimensionality for beyond 2D high dimensional problems, which is the subject of our future work.</description>

      <title>Probing topological degeneracy on a torus using superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of topological order (TO) can be defined through the characteristic ground state degeneracy of a system placed on a manifold with non-zero genus $g$, such as a torus. This ground state degeneracy has served as a key tool for identifying TOs in theoretical calculations but it has never been possible to probe experimentally because fabricating a device in the requisite toroidal geometry is generally not feasible. Here we discuss a practical method that can be used to overcome this difficulty in a class of topologically ordered systems that consist of a TO and its time reversal conjugate $\overline{\rm TO}$. The key insight is that a system possessing such ${\rm TO}\otimes\overline{\rm TO}$ order fabricated on an annulus behaves effectively as TO on a torus, provided that one supplies a symmetry-breaking perturbation that gaps out the edge modes. We illustrate this general principle using a specific example of a spin-polarized $p_x\pm ip_y$ chiral superconductor which is closely related to the Moore-Read Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall state. Specifically, we introduce a simple model with altermagnetic normal state which, in the presence of an attractive interaction, hosts a helical $(p_x-ip_y)^\uparrow\otimes(p_x+ip_y)^\downarrow$ superconducting ground state. We demonstrate that when placed on an annulus with the appropriate symmetry-breaking edge perturbation this planar two-dimensional system, remarkably, exhibits the same pattern of ground state degeneracy as a $p_x+ ip_y$ superconductor on a torus. We discuss broader implications of this behavior and ways it can be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Optimized Tradeoffs for Private Prediction with Majority Ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a classical problem in private prediction, the problem of computing an $(m\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private majority of $K$ $(\epsilon, \Delta)$-differentially private algorithms for $1 \leq m \leq K$ and $1 &gt; \delta \geq \Delta \geq 0$. Standard methods such as subsampling or randomized response are widely used, but do they provide optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs? To answer this, we introduce the Data-dependent Randomized Response Majority (DaRRM) algorithm. It is parameterized by a data-dependent noise function $\gamma$, and enables efficient utility optimization over the class of all private algorithms, encompassing those standard methods. We show that maximizing the utility of an $(m\epsilon, \delta)$-private majority algorithm can be computed tractably through an optimization problem for any $m \leq K$ by a novel structural result that reduces the infinitely many privacy constraints into a polynomial set. In some settings, we show that DaRRM provably enjoys a privacy gain of a factor of 2 over common baselines, with fixed utility. Lastly, we demonstrate the strong empirical effectiveness of our first-of-its-kind privacy-constrained utility optimization for ensembling labels for private prediction from private teachers in image classification. Notably, our DaRRM framework with an optimized $\gamma$ exhibits substantial utility gains when compared against several baselines.</description>

      <title>Addressing Architectural Obstacles for Overlay with Stream Network Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overlay is an effective approach for creating FPGA-based AI accelerators, enabling software-programmable specialized hardware datapaths to flexibly support various DNN operations. Traditional DNN overlays typically base their instruction set design on the von Neumann model but adapt them to be more coarse-grained. These instruction sets control execution at the layer granularity and impose restricted patterns for mapping computation and bandwidth resources. Such constraints cause inefficiencies from the imperfect match between supported execution patterns and diverse DNN layer shapes and types. This work proposes a Reconfigurable Stream Network architecture, a unique ISA abstraction tailored for flexible FPGA overlay execution at low cost, marking it as the first known FPGA design to support dynamic sequential linear layer pipelining. This novel architecture presents a datapath abstraction modeled after a specialized circuit-switched network with stateful functional units (FUs) as nodes and data streaming on edges. Programming a computation corresponds to triggering a network path in this stream-connected datapath. The program can individually control FUs to form paths that exploit both spatial and pipeline parallelism between independent and dependent concurrent computations. We present a proof-of-concept design RSN-XNN on the Versal VCK190. Evaluations show a 22x latency reduction for BERT compared to the state of the art, along with throughput improvements of 3.2x, 2.4x, 2.5x, and 2.8x for BERT, VIT, NCF, and MLP, respectively. RSN-XNN matches the latency of the T4 GPU with the same FP32 performance but only 18% of the memory bandwidth.

      <title>QuaLLM-Health: An Adaptation of an LLM-Based Framework for Quantitative Data Extraction from Online Health Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health-related discussions on social media like Reddit offer valuable insights, but extracting quantitative data from unstructured text is challenging. In this work, we present an adapted framework from QuaLLM into QuaLLM-Health for extracting clinically relevant quantitative data from Reddit discussions about glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists using large language models (LLMs). We collected 410k posts and comments from five GLP-1-related communities using the Reddit API in July 2024. After filtering for cancer-related discussions, 2,059 unique entries remained. We developed annotation guidelines to manually extract variables such as cancer survivorship, family cancer history, cancer types mentioned, risk perceptions, and discussions with physicians. Two domain-experts independently annotated a random sample of 100 entries to create a gold-standard dataset. We then employed iterative prompt engineering with OpenAI's "GPT-4o-mini" on the gold-standard dataset to build an optimized pipeline that allowed us to extract variables from the large dataset. The optimized LLM achieved accuracies above 0.85 for all variables, with precision, recall and F1 score macro averaged &gt; 0.90, indicating balanced performance. Stability testing showed a 95% match rate across runs, confirming consistency. Applying the framework to the full dataset enabled efficient extraction of variables necessary for downstream analysis, costing under $3 and completing in approximately one hour. QuaLLM-Health demonstrates that LLMs can effectively and efficiently extract clinically relevant quantitative data from unstructured social media content. Incorporating human expertise and iterative prompt refinement ensures accuracy and reliability. This methodology can be adapted for large-scale analysis of patient-generated data across various health domains, facilitating valuable insights for healthcare research.</description>

      <title>A Size-Dependent Ideal Solution Model for Liquid-Solid Phase Equilibria Prediction in Aqueous Organic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid-solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entopic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power, while offering new insight into the thermodynamic nature of aqueous organic solutions. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59\%, eutectic temperature by 45\%, and eutectic composition by 43\%, as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a direct progenitor detection for the Type Ic SN 2017ein based on late-time observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($&gt;$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulation has become one of the most important tools in scientific research in many disciplines. Benefiting from the dynamical trajectories regulated by versatile interatomic interactions, various material properties can be quantitatively characterized at the atomic scale. This greatly deepens our understanding of Nature and provides incredible insights supplementing experimental observations. Hitherto, a plethora of literature discusses the computational discoveries in studying glasses in which positional disorder is inherent in their configurations. Motivated by active research and knowledge sharing, we developed a data analysis library in Python for computational materials science research. We hope to help promote scientific progress and narrow some technical gaps for the wide communities. The toolkit mainly focuses on physical analyses of glassy properties from the open-source simulator LAMMPS. Nevertheless, the code design renders high flexibility, with functionalities extendable to other computational tools. The library provides data-driven insights for different subjects and can be incorporated into advanced machine-learning workflows. The scope of the data analysis methodologies applies not only to materials science but also to physics, chemistry, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Cerebral Blood Flow Prediction With Clinical Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of cerebral blood flow is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Traditional computational methods, however, often incur significant computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time clinical applications. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) to predict blood flow and pressure in previously unseen cerebral vascular network structures that were not included in training data. The GNN was developed using clinical datasets from patients with stenosis, featuring complex and abnormal vascular geometries. Additionally, the GNN model was trained on data incorporating a wide range of inflow conditions, vessel topologies, and network connectivities to enhance its generalization capability. The approach achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.727 for pressure and 0.824 for flow rate, with sufficient training data. These findings demonstrate the potential of the GNN for real-time cerebrovascular diagnostics, particularly in handling intricate and pathological vascular networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be a field of characteristic zero. Motivated by the fundamental question of whether it is possible for the universal enveloping algebra of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra to be noetherian, we study Lie algebras of derivations of associative algebras. The main result of this paper is that the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of derivations of a finitely generated $\Bbbk$-algebra is not noetherian. This extends a result of Sierra and Walton on the Witt algebra, as well as a result of the second author on Krichever-Novikov algebras. We highlight that the result applies to derivations of both commutative and noncommutative algebras without restriction on their growth.</description>

      <title>Improved implicit diffusion model with knowledge distillation to estimate the spatial distribution density of carbon stock in remote sensing imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forest serves as the most significant terrestrial carbon stock mechanism, effectively reducing atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations and mitigating climate change. Remote sensing provides high data accuracy and enables large-scale observations. Optical images facilitate long-term monitoring, which is crucial for future carbon stock estimation studies. This study focuses on Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, utilizing GF-1 WFV satellite imagery. The KD-VGG and KD-UNet modules were introduced for initial feature extraction, and the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM) was proposed. The results showed: (1) The VGG module improved initial feature extraction, improving accuracy, and reducing inference time with optimized model parameters. (2) The Cross-attention + MLPs module enabled effective feature fusion, establishing critical relationships between global and local features, achieving high-accuracy estimation. (3) The IIDM model, a novel contribution, demonstrated the highest estimation accuracy with an RMSE of 12.17\%, significantly improving by 41.69\% to 42.33\% compared to the regression model. In carbon stock estimation, the generative model excelled in extracting deeper features, significantly outperforming other models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-generated content in quantitative remote sensing. The 16-meter resolution estimates provide a robust basis for tailoring forest carbon sink regulations, enhancing regional carbon stock management.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of solution to a hyperbolic-parabolic free boundary problem for biofilm growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the existence and uniqueness of solution to a free boundary value problem related to biofilm growth. The problem consists of a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations governing the microbial species growth, and a system of parabolic partial differential equations describing the substrate dynamics. The free boundary evolution is governed by an ordinary differential equation that accounts for the thickness of the biofilm. We use the method of characteristics and fixed point strategies to prove the existence and uniqueness theorem in small and all times. All the equations are converted into integral equations, in particular this transformation is made for the parabolic equations by using the Green's functions. We consider Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Robin boundary conditions for the substrates equations and their extension to the case with variable</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal C$ be a $(d+2)$-angulated category. In this paper, we define the notions of cotorsion pairs and weak cotorsion pairs in $\mathcal C$, which are generalizations of the classical cotorsion pairs in triangulated categories. As an application, we give a geometric characterization of weak cotorsion pairs in $(d+2)$-angulated cluster categories of type $A$. Moreover, we prove that any mutation of a (weak) cotorsion pair in $\mathcal C$ is again a (weak) cotorsion pair. When $d=1$, this result generalizes the work of Zhou and Zhu on classical cotorsion pairs in triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Identifying dark matter signals by the radio continuum spectral data of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the signals of dark matter annihilation is one of the most popular ways to understand the nature of dark matter. In particular, many recent studies are focussing on using radio data to examine the possible signals of dark matter revealed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In this article, we investigate on the spectral data of the central radio halo of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638. We show that the radio spectral data can be best accounted by the synchrotron emission due to dark matter annihilation via $\tau$ lepton channel (with dark matter mass $m=15$ GeV) or $b$ quark channel (with dark matter mass $m=110$ GeV), although using the very coarse spectral data with notable errors. Despite the fact that cosmic-ray emission can also provide a good explanation for the observed radio spectrum, our results suggest a possible positive evidence for dark matter annihilation revealed in the form of radio emission in RX J1720.1+2638 cluster.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the inverse Monge-Ampere flow, which was introduced by Collins, Hisamoto and Takahashi. We provide conditions that guarantee the convergence of the flow without a priori assumption that $X$ has a K\"ahler-Einstein metric. We also show that if the underlying manifold does not admit K\"ahler-Einstein metric, then the flow develops Nadel multiplier ideal sheaves. In addition, we establish the linear lower bound for $\inf_X\varphi$ under the additional assumption on the behavior of the volume form, and the theorem of Darvas and He for the inverse Monge-Ampere flow.</description>

Abstract: We study the gradient flow of the Allen-Cahn equation with fixed boundary contact angle in Euclidean domains for initial data with bounded energy. Under general assumptions, we establish both interior and boundary convergence properties for the solutions and associated energy measures. Under various boundary non-concentration assumptions, we show that, for almost every time, the associated limiting varifolds satisfy generalised contact angle conditions and have bounded first variation, as well as deducing that the trace of the limit of the solutions coincides with the limit of their traces. Moreover, we derive an Ilmanen type monotonicity formula, for initial data with bounded energy, valid for the associated energy measures up to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Vision Mamba Distillation for Low-resolution Fine-grained Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resolution fine-grained image classification has recently made significant progress, largely thanks to the super-resolution techniques and knowledge distillation methods. However, these approaches lead to an exponential increase in the number of parameters and computational complexity of models. In order to solve this problem, in this letter, we propose a Vision Mamba Distillation (ViMD) approach to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of low-resolution fine-grained image classification. Concretely, a lightweight super-resolution vision Mamba classification network (SRVM-Net) is proposed to improve its capability for extracting visual features by redesigning the classification sub-network with Mamba modeling. Moreover, we design a novel multi-level Mamba knowledge distillation loss boosting the performance, which can transfer prior knowledge obtained from a High-resolution Vision Mamba classification Network (HRVM-Net) as a teacher into the proposed SRVM-Net as a student. Extensive experiments on seven public fine-grained classification datasets related to benchmarks confirm our ViMD achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. While having higher accuracy, ViMD outperforms similar methods with fewer parameters and FLOPs, which is more suitable for embedded device applications. Code is available at https://github.com/boa2004plaust/ViMD.</description>

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

      <title>Optimized Conformal Selection: Powerful Selective Inference After Conformity Score Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model selection/optimization in conformal inference is challenging, since it may break the exchangeability between labeled and unlabeled data. We study this problem in the context of conformal selection, which uses conformal p-values to select ``interesting'' instances with large unobserved labels from a pool of unlabeled data, while controlling the FDR in finite sample. For validity, existing solutions require the model choice to be independent of the data used to construct the p-values and calibrate the selection set. However, when presented with many model choices and limited labeled data, it is desirable to (i) select the best model in a data-driven manner, and (ii) mitigate power loss due to sample splitting.
  This paper presents OptCS, a general framework that allows valid statistical testing (selection) after flexible data-driven model optimization. We introduce general conditions under which OptCS constructs valid conformal p-values despite substantial data reuse and handles complex p-value dependencies to maintain finite-sample FDR control via a novel multiple testing procedure. We instantiate this general recipe to propose three FDR-controlling procedures, each optimizing the models differently: (i) selecting the most powerful one among multiple pre-trained candidate models, (ii) using all data for model fitting without sample splitting, and (iii) combining full-sample model fitting and selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulation studies and real applications in drug discovery and alignment of large language models in radiology report generation.</description>

      <title>RS-vHeat: Heat Conduction Guided Efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing foundation models largely break away from the traditional paradigm of designing task-specific models, offering greater scalability across multiple tasks. However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with high-resolution remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduces memory consumption by 84%, decreases FLOPs by 24% and improves throughput by 2.7 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and let $\left[V\atop k\right]_q$ denote the family of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \left[V\atop k\right]_q$ is called intersecting if for all $F$, $F'\in\mathcal{F}$, we have ${\rm dim}$$(F\cap F')\geq 1$. Let $\delta_{d}(\mathcal{F})$ denote the minimum degree in $\mathcal{F}$ of all $d$-dimensional subspaces. In this paper we show that $\delta_{d}(\mathcal{F})\leq \left[n-d-1\atop k-d-1\right]$ in any intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \left[V\atop k\right]_q$, where $k&gt;d\geq 2$ and $n\geq 2k+1$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Covert mmWave MIMO with Finite-Resolution DACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hybrid beamforming design for covert millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output systems with finite-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which impose practical hardware constraints not yet considered by the existing works and have negative impact on the covertness. Based on the additive quantization noise model, we derive the detection error probability of the warden considering finite-resolution DACs. Aiming at maximizing the sum covert rate (SCR) between the transmitter and legitimate users, we design hybrid beamformers subject to power and covertness constraints. To solve this nonconvex joint optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme based on fractional programming, quadratic transformation, and inner majorization-minimization methods to iteratively optimize the analog and digital beamformers. To reduce the computational complexity of the AO scheme, we propose a vector-space based heuristic (VSH) scheme to design the hybrid beamformer. We prove that as the number of antennas grows to be infinity, the SCR in the VSH scheme can approach the channel mutual information. Simulation results show that the AO and VSH schemes outperform the existing schemes and the VSH scheme can be used to obtain an initialization for the AO scheme to speed up its convergence.</description>

      <title>P4-NIDS: High-Performance Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection in P4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-performance, scalable network monitoring and intrusion detection system (IDS) implemented in P4. The proposed solution is designed for high-performance environments such as cloud data centers, where ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and resilient infrastructure are essential. Existing state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions, which rely on traditional out-of-band monitoring and intrusion detection techniques, often struggle to achieve the necessary latency and scalability in large-scale, high-speed networks. Unlike these approaches, our in-band solution provides a more efficient, scalable alternative that meets the performance needs of Terabit networks. Our monitoring component captures extended NetFlow v9 features at wire speed, while the in-band IDS achieves high-accuracy detection without compromising on performance. In evaluations on real-world P4 hardware, both the NetFlow monitoring and IDS components maintain negligible impact on throughput, even at traffic rates up to 8 million packets per second (mpps). This performance surpasses SoA in terms of accuracy and throughput efficiency, ensuring that our solution meets the requirements of large-scale, high-performance environments.</description>

      <title>On the integration of Manin pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a remarkable fact that the integrability of a Poisson manifold to a symplectic groupoid depends only on the integrability of its cotangent Lie algebroid $A$: The source-simply connected Lie groupoid $G\rightrightarrows M$ integrating $A$ automatically acquires a multiplicative symplectic 2-form. More generally, a similar result holds for the integration of Lie bialgebroids to Poisson groupoids, as well as in the `quasi' settings of Dirac structures and quasi-Lie bialgebroids. In this article, we will place these results into a general context of Manin pairs $(\mathbb{E},A)$, thereby obtaining a simple geometric approach to these integration results. We also clarify the case where the groupoid $G$ integrating $A$ is not source-simply connected. Furthermore, we obtain a description of Hamiltonian spaces for Poisson groupoids and quasi-symplectic groupoids within this formalism.</description>

      <title>Regularized Multi-LLMs Collaboration for Enhanced Score-based Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the significance of understanding the cause-and-effect relationships among variables increases in the development of modern systems and algorithms, learning causality from observational data has become a preferred and efficient approach over conducting randomized control trials. However, purely observational data could be insufficient to reconstruct the true causal graph. Consequently, many researchers tried to utilise some form of prior knowledge to improve causal discovery process. In this context, the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the costly acquisition of prior expert knowledge. In this work, we further explore the potential of using LLMs to enhance causal discovery approaches, particularly focusing on score-based methods, and we propose a general framework to utilise the capacity of not only one but multiple LLMs to augment the discovery process.</description>

      <title>Beam Switching Based Beam Design for High-Speed Train mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For high-speed train (HST) millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, the use of narrow beams with small beam coverage needs frequent beam switching, while wider beams with small beam gain leads to weaker mmWave signal strength. In this paper, we consider beam switching based beam design, which is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the number of switched beams within a predetermined railway range subject to that the receiving signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) at the HST is no lower than a predetermined threshold. To solve this problem, we propose two sequential beam design schemes, both including two alternately-performed stages. In the first stage, given an updated beam coverage according to the railway range, we transform the problem into a feasibility problem and further convert it into a min-max optimization problem by relaxing the RSNR constraints into a penalty of the objective function. In the second stage, we evaluate the feasibility of the beamformer obtained from solving the min-max problem and determine the beam coverage accordingly. Simulation results show that compared to the first scheme, the second scheme can achieve 96.20\% reduction in computational complexity at the cost of only 0.0657\% performance degradation.</description>

      <title>VideoLLM Knows When to Speak: Enhancing Time-Sensitive Video Comprehension with Video-Text Duet Interaction Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent researches on video large language models (VideoLLM) predominantly focus on model architectures and training datasets, leaving the interaction format between the user and the model under-explored. In existing works, users often interact with VideoLLMs by using the entire video and a query as input, after which the model generates a response. This interaction format constrains the application of VideoLLMs in scenarios such as live-streaming comprehension where videos do not end and responses are required in a real-time manner, and also results in unsatisfactory performance on time-sensitive tasks that requires localizing video segments. In this paper, we focus on a video-text duet interaction format. This interaction format is characterized by the continuous playback of the video, and both the user and the model can insert their text messages at any position during the video playback. When a text message ends, the video continues to play, akin to the alternative of two performers in a duet. We construct MMDuetIT, a video-text training dataset designed to adapt VideoLLMs to video-text duet interaction format. We also introduce the Multi-Answer Grounded Video Question Answering (MAGQA) task to benchmark the real-time response ability of VideoLLMs. Trained on MMDuetIT, MMDuet demonstrates that adopting the video-text duet interaction format enables the model to achieve significant improvements in various time-sensitive tasks (76% CIDEr on YouCook2 dense video captioning, 90\% mAP on QVHighlights highlight detection and 25% R@0.5 on Charades-STA temporal video grounding) with minimal training efforts, and also enable VideoLLMs to reply in a real-time manner as the video plays.

      <title>New Faithfulness-Centric Interpretability Paradigms for Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning becomes more widespread and is used in more critical applications, it's important to provide explanations for these models, to prevent unintended behavior. Unfortunately, many current interpretability methods struggle with faithfulness. Therefore, this Ph.D. thesis investigates the question "How to provide and ensure faithful explanations for complex general-purpose neural NLP models?" The main thesis is that we should develop new paradigms in interpretability. This is achieved by first developing solid faithfulness metrics and then applying the lessons learned from this investigation to develop new paradigms. The two new paradigms explored are faithfulness measurable models (FMMs) and self-explanations. The idea in self-explanations is to have large language models explain themselves, we identify that current models are not capable of doing this consistently. However, we suggest how this could be achieved. The idea of FMMs is to create models that are designed such that measuring faithfulness is cheap and precise. This makes it possible to optimize an explanation towards maximum faithfulness, which makes FMMs designed to be explained. We find that FMMs yield explanations that are near theoretical optimal in terms of faithfulness. Overall, from all investigations of faithfulness, results show that post-hoc and intrinsic explanations are by default model and task-dependent. However, this was not the case when using FMMs, even with the same post-hoc explanation methods. This shows, that even simple modifications to the model, such as randomly masking the training dataset, as was done in FMMs, can drastically change the situation and result in consistently faithful explanations. This answers the question of how to provide and ensure faithful explanations.</description>

      <title>DRS: Deep Question Reformulation With Structured Output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, when people encounter completely new knowledge texts, they often ask questions that the text cannot answer due to a lack of understanding of the knowledge. Recent research shows that large language models identify the unanswerability of questions, but they lack the ability to help people reformulate their questions. Even powerful models like GPT-3.5 perform poorly in this regard. To enhance the ability of LLMs to assist humans in reformulating questions to extract relevant knowledge from new documents, we propose a zero-shot method called DRS: Deep Question Reformulation With Structured Output. Our proposed method leverages large language models and the DFS-based algorithm to iteratively search for possible entity combinations and constrain the output with certain entities, effectively improving the capabilities of large language models in this area. Extensive experimental results show that our zero-shot DRS method significantly improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42% and effectively improves the score of open-source large language models, such as Gemma2-9B, from 26.35% to 56.75%.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Inverse Rendering with Interpretable Basis BRDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse rendering seeks to reconstruct both geometry and spatially varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs) from captured images. To address the inherent ill-posedness of inverse rendering, basis BRDF representations are commonly used, modeling SVBRDFs as spatially varying blends of a set of basis BRDFs. However, existing methods often yield basis BRDFs that lack intuitive separation and have limited scalability to scenes of varying complexity. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable inverse rendering method that produces interpretable basis BRDFs. Our approach models a scene using 2D Gaussians, where the reflectance of each Gaussian is defined by a weighted blend of basis BRDFs. We efficiently render an image from the 2D Gaussians and basis BRDFs using differentiable rasterization and impose a rendering loss with the input images. During this analysis-by-synthesis optimization process of differentiable inverse rendering, we dynamically adjust the number of basis BRDFs to fit the target scene while encouraging sparsity in the basis weights. This ensures that the reflectance of each Gaussian is represented by only a few basis BRDFs. This approach enables the reconstruction of accurate geometry and interpretable basis BRDFs that are spatially separated. Consequently, the resulting scene representation, comprising basis BRDFs and 2D Gaussians, supports physically-based novel-view relighting and intuitive scene editing.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Misalignment in Multispectral Pedestrian Detection: A Language-Driven Approach for Cross-modal Alignment Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispectral pedestrian detection is a crucial component in various critical applications. However, a significant challenge arises due to the misalignment between these modalities, particularly under real-world conditions where data often appear heavily misaligned. Conventional methods developed on well-aligned or minimally misaligned datasets fail to address these discrepancies adequately. This paper introduces a new framework for multispectral pedestrian detection designed specifically to handle heavily misaligned datasets without the need for costly and complex traditional pre-processing calibration. By leveraging Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLM) for cross-modal semantic alignment, our approach seeks to enhance detection accuracy by aligning semantic information across the RGB and thermal domains. This method not only simplifies the operational requirements but also extends the practical usability of multispectral detection technologies in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Ramsey--Dirac theory for bounded degree hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey--Tur\'an theory considers Tur\'an type questions in Ramsey-context, asking for the existence of a small subgraph in a graph $G$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ lacks an appropriate subgraph $F$, such as a clique of linear size. Similarly, one can consider Dirac-type questions in Ramsey context, asking for the existence of a spanning subgraph $H$ in a graph $G$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ lacks an appropriate subgraph $F$, which we call a Ramsey--Dirac theory question.
  When $H$ is a connected spanning subgraph, the disjoint union $K_{n/2}\cup K_{n/2}$ of two large cliques shows that it is natural to consider complete bipartite graphs $F$. Indeed, Han, Hu, Ping, Wang, Wang and Yang in 2024 proved that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\delta(G)=\Omega(n)$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ does not contain any complete bipartite graph $K_{m,m}$ with $m=\Omega(n)$, then $G$ contains every $n$-vertex bounded degree tree $T$ as a subgraph.
  Extending this result to the Ramsey--Dirac theory for hypertrees, we prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph with $\delta(G)=\Omega(n^{r-1})$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ does not contain any complete $r$-partite hypergraph $K_{m,m,\dots, m}$ with $m=\Omega(n)$, then $G$ contains every $n$-vertex bounded degree hypertree $T$ as a subgraph. We also prove the existence of matchings and loose Hamilton cycles in the same setting, which extends the result of Mcdiarmid and Yolov into hypergraphs.
  This result generalizes the universality result on randomly perturbed graphs by B\"ottcher, Han, Kohayakawa, Montgomery, Parczyk and Person in 2019 into hypergraphs and also strengthen the results on quasirandom hypergraphs by Lenz, Mubayi and Mycroft in 2016 and Lenz and Mubayi in 2016 into hypergraphs satisfying a much weaker pseudorandomness condition.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Uncertainty and Its Propagation in Seismic Velocity Structure and Earthquake Source Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earthquake source inversions aimed at understanding diverse fault activities on earthquake faults using seismic observation data, uncertainties in velocity structure models are typically not considered. As a result, biases and underestimations of uncertainty can occur in source inversion. This article provides an overview of the author's efforts to address this issue by quantitatively evaluating the uncertainty in velocity structure models and appropriately accounting for its propagation into source inversion. First, the Bayesian multi-model source inversion method that can incorporate such uncertainties as probability distributions in the form of ensembles is explained. Next, a Bayesian traveltime tomography technique utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to quantify uncertainties in velocity structure models is introduced. Furthermore, the author's recent efforts to integrate these methods and apply them to hypocenter determination in the Nankai Trough region are briefly discussed. The article also outlines future prospects of source inversions considering uncertainties in velocity structure models and the anticipated role of the emerging scientific machine learning (SciML) methods such as PINN.</description>

      <title>Speech Separation using Neural Audio Codecs with Embedding Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have revolutionized audio processing by enabling speech tasks to be performed on highly compressed representations. Recent work has shown that speech separation can be achieved within these compressed domains, offering faster training and reduced inference costs. However, current approaches still rely on waveform-based loss functions, necessitating unnecessary decoding steps during training. We propose a novel embedding loss for neural audio codec-based speech separation that operates directly on compressed audio representations, eliminating the need for decoding during training. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using both objective metrics and perceptual assessment techniques, including intrusive and non-intrusive methods. Our results demonstrate that embedding loss can be used to train codec-based speech separation models with a 2x improvement in training speed and computational cost while achieving better DNSMOS and STOI performance on the WSJ0-2mix dataset across 3 different pre-trained codecs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pareto-optimal Ranking Method for Comparing Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the interest in multi- and many-objective optimization algorithms grows, the performance comparison of these algorithms becomes increasingly important. A large number of performance indicators for multi-objective optimization algorithms have been introduced, each of which evaluates these algorithms based on a certain aspect. Therefore, assessing the quality of multi-objective results using multiple indicators is essential to guarantee that the evaluation considers all quality perspectives. This paper proposes a novel multi-metric comparison method to rank the performance of multi-/ many-objective optimization algorithms based on a set of performance indicators. We utilize the Pareto optimality concept (i.e., non-dominated sorting algorithm) to create the rank levels of algorithms by simultaneously considering multiple performance indicators as criteria/objectives. As a result, four different techniques are proposed to rank algorithms based on their contribution at each Pareto level. This method allows researchers to utilize a set of existing/newly developed performance metrics to adequately assess/rank multi-/many-objective algorithms. The proposed methods are scalable and can accommodate in its comprehensive scheme any newly introduced metric. The method was applied to rank 10 competing algorithms in the 2018 CEC competition solving 15 many-objective test problems. The Pareto-optimal ranking was conducted based on 10 well-known multi-objective performance indicators and the results were compared to the final ranks reported by the competition, which were based on the inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume indicator (HV) measures. The techniques suggested in this paper have broad applications in science and engineering, particularly in areas where multiple metrics are used for comparisons. Examples include machine learning and data mining.</description>

      <title>Exploring Visual Vulnerabilities via Multi-Loss Adversarial Search for Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite inheriting security measures from underlying language models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) may still be vulnerable to safety alignment issues. Through empirical analysis, we uncover two critical findings: scenario-matched images can significantly amplify harmful outputs, and contrary to common assumptions in gradient-based attacks, minimal loss values do not guarantee optimal attack effectiveness. Building on these insights, we introduce MLAI (Multi-Loss Adversarial Images), a novel jailbreak framework that leverages scenario-aware image generation for semantic alignment, exploits flat minima theory for robust adversarial image selection, and employs multi-image collaborative attacks for enhanced effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate MLAI's significant impact, achieving attack success rates of 77.75% on MiniGPT-4 and 82.80% on LLaVA-2, substantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 34.37% and 12.77% respectively. Furthermore, MLAI shows considerable transferability to commercial black-box VLMs, achieving up to 60.11% success rate. Our work reveals fundamental visual vulnerabilities in current VLMs safety mechanisms and underscores the need for stronger defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful example text.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Actuation for Insect-Scale Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new evolution of the Very Little Eel-Inspired roBot, the VLEIBot++, a 900-mg swimmer driven by two 10-mg bare high-work density (HWD) actuators, whose functionality is based on the use of shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires. An actuator of this type consumes an average power of about 40 mW during in-air operation. We integrated onboard power and computation into the VLEIBot++ using a custom-built printed circuit board (PCB) and an 11-mAh 3.7-V 507-mg single-cell lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery, which in conjunction enable autonomous swimming for about 20 min on a single charge. This robot can swim at speeds of up to 18.7 mm/s (0.46 Bl/s) and is the first subgram microswimmer with onboard power, actuation, and computation developed to date. Unfortunately, the approach employed to actuate VLEIBot++ prototypes is infeasible for underwater applications because a typical 10-mg bare SMA-based microactuator requires an average power on the order of 800 mW when operating underwater. To address this issue, we introduce a new 13-mg power-efficient high-performance SMA-based microactuator that can function with similar power requirements (approx. 80 mW on average) and actuation performance (approx. 3 mm at low frequencies) in air and water. This design is based on the use of a sealed flexible air-capsule that encloses the SMA wires that drive the microactuator with the purpose of passively controlling the heat-transfer rate of the thermal system. Furthermore, this new power-efficient encapsulated actuator requires low voltages of excitation (3 to 4 V) and simple power electronics to function. The breakthroughs presented in this paper represent a path towards the creation of insect-scale autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Two-Stream Network Based on RGB Flow and Representation Flow for Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, computer vision tasks have seen significant improvements, making two-stream neural networks a popular focus for video based action recognition. Traditional models using RGB and optical flow streams achieve strong performance but at a high computational cost. To address this, we introduce a representation flow algorithm to replace the optical flow branch in the egocentric action recognition model, enabling end-to-end training while reducing computational cost and prediction time. Our model, designed for egocentric action recognition, uses class activation maps (CAMs) to improve accuracy and ConvLSTM for spatio temporal encoding with spatial attention. When evaluated on the GTEA61, EGTEA GAZE+, and HMDB datasets, our model matches the accuracy of the original model on GTEA61 and exceeds it by 0.65% and 0.84% on EGTEA GAZE+ and HMDB, respectively. Prediction runtimes are significantly reduced to 0.1881s, 0.1503s, and 0.1459s, compared to the original model's 101.6795s, 25.3799s, and 203.9958s. Ablation studies were also conducted to study the impact of different parameters on model performance.

      <title>HAAT: Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

      <title>First-order hold lossless convexification: theoretical guarantees for discrete-time optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossless Convexification (LCvx) is a clever trick that transforms a class of nonconvex optimal control problems (where the nonconvexity arises from a lower bound on the control norm) into equivalent convex problems via convex relaxations, the goal being to solve these problems efficiently via polynomial-time numerical solvers. However, to solve these infinite-dimensional problems in practice, they must first be converted into finite-dimensional problems, and it remains an open area of research to ensure the theoretical guarantees of LCvx are maintained across this discretization step. Prior work has proven guarantees for zero-order hold control parameterization. In this work, we extend these results to the more general, and practically useful, first-order hold control parameterization. We first show that under mild assumptions, we are guaranteed a solution that violates our nonconvex constraint at no more than $n_x + 1$ vertices in our discretized trajectory (where $n_x$ is the dimension of our state-space). Then, we discuss an algorithm that, for a specific case of problems, finds a solution where our nonconvex constraint is violated along no more than $2n_x + 2$ edges in at most $\lceil \log_2 ((\rho_{\max} - \rho_{\min}) / \varepsilon_\rho) \rceil + 1$ calls to our solver (where $[\rho_{\min}, \rho_{\max}]$ represent the bounds on our control norm and $\varepsilon_\rho$ is some desired suboptimality tolerance). Finally, we provide numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication for Joint Image Transmission and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing communication efficiency. However, most existing research emphasizes single-task reconstruction, neglecting model adaptability and generalization across multi-task systems. In this paper, we propose a novel generative semantic communication system that supports both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Our approach builds upon semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at both the transmitter and receiver, with each semantic KB comprising a source KB and a task KB. The source KB at the transmitter leverages a hierarchical Swin-Transformer, a generative AI scheme, to extract multi-level features from the input image. Concurrently, the counterpart source KB at the receiver utilizes hierarchical residual blocks to generate task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the two task KBs adopt a semantic similarity model to map different task requirements into pre-defined task instructions, thereby facilitating the feature selection of the source KBs. Additionally, we develop a unified residual block-based joint source and channel (JSCC) encoder and two task-specific JSCC decoders to achieve the two image tasks. In particular, a generative diffusion model is adopted to construct the JSCC decoder for the image reconstruction task. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-task generative semantic communication system outperforms previous single-task communication systems in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Development of a bunching ionizer for TOF mass spectrometers with reduced resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some types of mass spectrometers, such as Time of Flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MSs), it is necessary to control pulsed beams of ions. This can be easily accomplished by applying a pulsed voltage to the pusher electrode while the ionizer is continuously flowing ions. This method is preferred for its simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here we employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate, which is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The benefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the start of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly advantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable. In this study, we used analytical and numerical methods to design a new bunching ionizer with reduced resources, adopting the principle of electrostatic ion beam trap. The test model experimentally demonstrated the bunching performance with respect to sample gas density and ion bunching time using gas samples and electron impact ionization. We also conducted an experiment in connection with a miniature TOF-MS, and showed that the sensitivity was improved by more than one order of magnitude using the newly developed ionizer. Since the device is capable of bunching ions with lower voltage and lower power consumption (~100 V, ~0.8 W) compared with conventional RF ion trap bunchers (several kilovolts, ~10 W), it will be possible to find applications in portable mass spectrometer with reduced resources.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Smartphone Solution for Digitizing Rapid Diagnostic Test Kits and Enhancing Accessibility for the Visually Impaired</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid diagnostic tests are crucial for timely disease detection and management, yet accurate interpretation of test results remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of rapid diagnostic test result interpretation by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), within a smartphone-based application. The app enables users to take pictures of their test kits, which YOLOv8 then processes to precisely crop and extract the membrane region, even if the test kit is not centered in the frame or is positioned at the very edge of the image. This capability offers greater accessibility, allowing even visually impaired individuals to capture test images without needing perfect alignment, thus promoting user independence and inclusivity. The extracted image is analyzed by an additional CNN classifier that determines if the results are positive, negative, or invalid, providing users with the results and a confidence level. Through validation experiments with commonly used rapid test kits across various diagnostic applications, our results demonstrate that the synergistic integration of AI significantly improves sensitivity and specificity in test result interpretation. This improvement can be attributed to the extraction of the membrane zones from the test kit images using the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm. Additionally, we performed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to investigate the factors influencing the model's decisions, identifying reasons behind both correct and incorrect classifications. By facilitating the differentiation of genuine test lines from background noise and providing valuable insights into test line intensity and uniformity, our approach offers a robust solution to challenges in rapid test interpretation.</description>

      <title>Causal and Local Correlations Based Network for Multivariate Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, time series classification has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and hundreds of methods have been proposed. However, these methods often ignore the spatial correlations among dimensions and the local correlations among features. To address this issue, the causal and local correlations based network (CaLoNet) is proposed in this study for multivariate time series classification. First, pairwise spatial correlations between dimensions are modeled using causality modeling to obtain the graph structure. Then, a relationship extraction network is used to fuse local correlations to obtain long-term dependency features. Finally, the graph structure and long-term dependency features are integrated into the graph neural network. Experiments on the UEA datasets show that CaLoNet can obtain competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Monocular Obstacle Avoidance Based on Inverse PPO for Fixed-wing UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most commonly used platforms for the burgeoning Low-altitude Economy (LAE) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), due to their long endurance and high-speed capabilities. Classical obstacle avoidance systems, which rely on prior maps or sophisticated sensors, face limitations in unknown low-altitude environments and small UAV platforms. In response, this paper proposes a lightweight deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based UAV collision avoidance system that enables a fixed-wing UAV to avoid unknown obstacles at cruise speed over 30m/s, with only onboard visual sensors. The proposed system employs a single-frame image depth inference module with a streamlined network architecture to ensure real-time obstacle detection, optimized for edge computing devices. After that, a reinforcement learning controller with a novel reward function is designed to balance the target approach and flight trajectory smoothness, satisfying the specific dynamic constraints and stability requirements of a fixed-wing UAV platform. An adaptive entropy adjustment mechanism is introduced to mitigate the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in DRL, improving training convergence and obstacle avoidance success rates. Extensive software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in obstacle avoidance efficiency and flight trajectory smoothness and confirm the feasibility of implementing the algorithm on edge devices.

      <title>JPPO: Joint Power and Prompt Optimization for Accelerated Large Language Model Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing deployment in wireless networks for a wide variety of user services. However, the growing longer prompt setting highlights the crucial issue of computational resource demands and huge communication load. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at user devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity and low bit error rates while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services. The system reduces response time by about 17%, with the improvement varying based on the length of the original prompt.</description>

      <title>Manual-PA: Learning 3D Part Assembly from Instruction Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembling furniture amounts to solving the discrete-continuous optimization task of selecting the furniture parts to assemble and estimating their connecting poses in a physically realistic manner. The problem is hampered by its combinatorially large yet sparse solution space thus making learning to assemble a challenging task for current machine learning models. In this paper, we attempt to solve this task by leveraging the assembly instructions provided in diagrammatic manuals that typically accompany the furniture parts. Our key insight is to use the cues in these diagrams to split the problem into discrete and continuous phases. Specifically, we present Manual-PA, a transformer-based instruction Manual-guided 3D Part Assembly framework that learns to semantically align 3D parts with their illustrations in the manuals using a contrastive learning backbone towards predicting the assembly order and infers the 6D pose of each part via relating it to the final furniture depicted in the manual. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the benchmark PartNet dataset. Our results show that using the diagrams and the order of the parts lead to significant improvements in assembly performance against the state of the art. Further, Manual-PA demonstrates strong generalization to real-world IKEA furniture assembly on the IKEA-Manual dataset.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Spatially Varying Correlations via the Thresholded Correlation Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in multimodal neuroimaging analysis is to understand the association between two imaging modalities and to identify brain regions where such an association is statistically significant. In this article, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric spatially varying correlation model to make inference of such regions. We build our model based on the thresholded correlation Gaussian process (TCGP). It ensures piecewise smoothness, sparsity, and jump discontinuity of spatially varying correlations, and is well applicable even when the number of subjects is limited or the signal-to-noise ratio is low. We study the identifiability of our model, establish the large support property, and derive the posterior consistency and selection consistency. We also develop a highly efficient Gibbs sampler and its variant to compute the posterior distribution. We illustrate the method with both simulations and an analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project.</description>

      <title>FASIONAD : FAst and Slow FusION Thinking Systems for Human-Like Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe, comfortable, and efficient navigation is a critical goal for autonomous driving systems. While end-to-end models trained on large-scale datasets excel in common driving scenarios, they often struggle with rare, long-tail events. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has introduced enhanced reasoning capabilities, but their computational demands pose challenges for real-time decision-making and precise planning. This paper presents FASIONAD, a novel dual-system framework inspired by the cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow." The fast system handles routine navigation tasks using rapid, data-driven path planning, while the slow system focuses on complex reasoning and decision-making in challenging or unfamiliar situations. A dynamic switching mechanism based on score distribution and feedback allows seamless transitions between the two systems. Visual prompts generated by the fast system enable human-like reasoning in the slow system, which provides high-quality feedback to enhance the fast system's decision-making. To evaluate FASIONAD, we introduce a new benchmark derived from the nuScenes dataset, specifically designed to differentiate fast and slow scenarios. FASIONAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, establishing a new standard for frameworks integrating fast and slow cognitive processes in autonomous driving. This approach paves the way for more adaptive, human-like autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphic Latent Neural Operator Learning for Data-Efficient Predictions of Solutions to Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computed approximation of the solution operator to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is needed in various areas of science and engineering. Neural operators have been shown to be quite effective at predicting these solution generators after training on high-fidelity ground truth data (e.g. numerical simulations). However, in order to generalize well to unseen spatial domains, neural operators must be trained on an extensive amount of geometrically varying data samples that may not be feasible to acquire or simulate in certain contexts (i.e., patient-specific medical data, large-scale computationally intensive simulations.) We propose that in order to learn a PDE solution operator that can generalize across multiple domains without needing to sample enough data expressive enough for all possible geometries, we can train instead a latent neural operator on just a few ground truth solution fields diffeomorphically mapped from different geometric/spatial domains to a fixed reference configuration. Furthermore, the form of the solutions is dependent on the choice of mapping to and from the reference domain. We emphasize that preserving properties of the differential operator when constructing these mappings can significantly reduce the data requirement for achieving an accurate model due to the regularity of the solution fields that the latent neural operator is training on. We provide motivating numerical experimentation that demonstrates an extreme case of this consideration by exploiting the conformal invariance of the Laplacian</description>

      <title>AEGIS: An Agent-based Framework for General Bug Reproduction from Issue Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In software maintenance, bug reproduction is essential for effective fault localization and repair. Manually writing reproduction scripts is a time-consuming task with high requirements for developers. Hence, automation of bug reproduction has increasingly attracted attention from researchers and practitioners. However, the existing studies on bug reproduction are generally limited to specific bug types such as program crashes, and hard to be applied to general bug reproduction. In this paper, considering the superior performance of agent-based methods in code intelligence tasks, we focus on designing an agent-based framework for the task. Directly employing agents would lead to limited bug reproduction performance, due to entangled subtasks, lengthy retrieved context, and unregulated actions. To mitigate the challenges, we propose an Automated gEneral buG reproductIon Scripts generation framework, named AEGIS, which is the first agent-based framework for the task. AEGIS mainly contains two modules: (1) A concise context construction module, which aims to guide the code agent in extracting structured information from issue descriptions, identifying issue-related code with detailed explanations, and integrating these elements to construct the concise context; (2) A FSM-based multi-feedback optimization module to further regulate the behavior of the code agent within the finite state machine (FSM), ensuring a controlled and efficient script generation process based on multi-dimensional feedback. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark dataset show that AEGIS outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 23.0% in F-&gt;P metric. In addition, the bug reproduction scripts generated by AEGIS can improve the relative resolved rate of Agentless by 12.5%.</description>

      <title>Topological Momentum Skyrmions in Mie Scattering Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quasiparticles such as skyrmions and merons have recently attracted enormous attentions in the form of diverse optical degrees of freedom. However, these structures have not been explored in the fundamental momentum vectors of optical fields yet. Here, we reveal the universality of forming skyrmion and meron topological textures from the Poynting vector, canonical momentum, and optical spin field, which are generated from multipole Mie scattering fields. Moreover, we analyze the unconditional topological stability of the skyrmionic momentum fields against perturbation and geometric defects. This work reveals the topological properties of multipole scattered field and will spur new phenomena related to optical forces, metamaterial design and unique light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Neural Finite-State Machines for Surgical Phase Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is essential for analyzing procedure-specific surgical videos. While recent transformer-based architectures have advanced sequence processing capabilities, they struggle with maintaining consistency across lengthy surgical procedures. Drawing inspiration from classical hidden Markov models' finite-state interpretations, we introduce the neural finite-state machine (NFSM) module, which bridges procedural understanding with deep learning approaches. NFSM combines procedure-level understanding with neural networks through global state embeddings, attention-based dynamic transition tables, and transition-aware training and inference mechanisms for offline and online applications. When integrated into our future-aware architecture, NFSM improves video-level accuracy, phase-level precision, recall, and Jaccard indices on Cholec80 datasets by 2.3, 3.2, 3.0, and 4.8 percentage points respectively. As an add-on module to existing state-of-the-art models like Surgformer, NFSM further enhances performance, demonstrating its complementary value. Extended experiments on non-surgical datasets validate NFSM's generalizability beyond surgical domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating NSFM into deep learning frameworks enables more robust and consistent phase recognition across long procedural videos.</description>

      <title>A Real-World Benchmark for Evaluating Fine-Grained Issue Solving Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically resolving software issues is crucial for software development in practice, impacting the software quality and user experience. The process of resolving real-world issues encompasses tasks such as question-answering (QA), fault localization, and code editing. Existing benchmarks such as HumanEval fall short in their ability to assess LLMs' proficiency in solving issues within a codebase. Although benchmarks like SWE-Bench are designed to evaluate the LLMs' capability to handle real-world GitHub issues, the end-to-end evaluation method cannot provide granular insights on the performance of subtasks involved in issue solving. To address existing deficiencies in benchmarking LLMs for practical software engineering tasks, we introduce FAUN-Eval, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Fine-grAined issUe solviNg capabilities of LLMs. FAUN-Eval systematically assesses LLMs across three distinct tasks: QA, fault localization, and code editing. This benchmark is constructed using a dataset curated from 30 well-known GitHub repositories. For each entry, issue and pull request (PR) pairs are meticulously compiled and validated using cross-referencing and keyword verification methods. FAUN-Eval includes 300 entries and employs both LLM and manual checks to ensure data quality. We evaluate ten LLMs with FAUN-Eval, including four closed-source and six open-source models. Our experimental results reveal several key findings. We find that the top-performing LLMs differ across the different tasks. Additionally, features in issues may lead LLMs to generate incorrect information. Moreover, models may vary in their proficiency with texts of different lengths.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations underestimate the effects of waves during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless plasma systems are often studied using fully kinetic simulations, where protons and electrons are treated as particles. Due to their computational expense, it is necessary to reduce the ion-to-electron mass ratio $m_i/m_e$ or the ratio between plasma and cyclotron frequencies in simulations of large systems. In this work we show that when electron-scale waves are present in larger-scale systems, numerical parameters affect their amplitudes and effects on the larger system. Using lower-hybrid drift waves during magnetic reconnection as an example, we find that the ratio between the wave electric field and the reconnection electric field scales like $\sqrt{m_i/m_e}$, while the phase relationship is also affected. The combination of these effects means that the anomalous drag that contributes to momentum balance in the reconnection region can be underestimated by an order of magnitude. The results are relevant to the coupling of electron-scale waves to ion-scale reconnection regions, and other systems such as collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>Can bidirectional encoder become the ultimate winner for downstream applications of foundation models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, Artificial Intelligence(AI) has progressed from the initial machine learning stage to the deep learning stage, and now to the stage of foundational models. Foundational models have the characteristics of pre-training, transfer learning, and self-supervised learning, and pre-trained models can be fine-tuned and applied to various downstream tasks. Under the framework of foundational models, models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer(GPT) have greatly advanced the development of natural language processing(NLP), especially the emergence of many models based on BERT. BERT broke through the limitation of only using one-way methods for language modeling in pre-training by using a masked language model. It can capture bidirectional context information to predict the masked words in the sequence, this can improve the feature extraction ability of the model. This makes the model very useful for downstream tasks, especially for specialized applications. The model using the bidirectional encoder can better understand the domain knowledge and be better applied to these downstream tasks. So we hope to help understand how this technology has evolved and improved model performance in various natural language processing tasks under the background of foundational models and reveal its importance in capturing context information and improving the model's performance on downstream tasks. This article analyzes one-way and bidirectional models based on GPT and BERT and compares their differences based on the purpose of the model. It also briefly analyzes BERT and the improvements of some models based on BERT. The model's performance on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset(SQuAD) and General Language Understanding Evaluation(GLUE) was compared.</description>

      <title>Persistent breather and dynamical symmetry in a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SO(2,1) dynamical symmetry makes a remarkable prediction that the breathing oscillation of a scale invariant quantum gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is isentropic and can persist indefinitely. In 2D, this symmetry is broken due to quantum anomaly in the strongly interacting range, and consequently the lifetime of the breathing mode becomes finite. The persistent breather in a strongly interacting system has so far not been realized. Here we experimentally achieve the long-lived breathing mode in a 3D unitary Fermi gas, which is protected by the SO(2,1) symmetry. The nearly perfect SO(2,1) symmetry is realized by loading the ultracold Fermi gas in an isotropic trap and tuning the interatomic interaction to resonance. The breathing mode oscillates at twice the trapping frequency even for large excitation amplitudes. The ratio of damping rate to oscillation frequency is as small as 0.002, providing an interacting persistent breather. The oscillation frequency and damping rate keep nearly constant for different atomic densities and temperatures, demonstrating the robustness of the SO(2,1) symmetry in 3D. The factors that lead to the residual damping have also been clarified. This work opens the way to study many-body non-equilibrium dynamics related to the dynamical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Leveraging A New GAN-based Transformer with ECDH Crypto-system for Enhancing Energy Theft Detection in Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting energy theft is vital for effectively managing power grids, as it ensures precise billing and prevents financial losses. Split-learning emerges as a promising decentralized machine learning technique for identifying energy theft while preserving user data confidentiality. Nevertheless, traditional split learning approaches are vulnerable to privacy leakage attacks, which significantly threaten data confidentiality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel GAN-Transformer-based split learning framework in this paper. This framework leverages the strengths of the transformer architecture, which is known for its capability to process long-range dependencies in energy consumption data. Thus, it enhances the accuracy of energy theft detection without compromising user privacy. A distinctive feature of our approach is the deployment of a novel mask-based method, marking a first in its field to effectively combat privacy leakage in split learning scenarios targeted at AI-enabled adversaries. This method protects sensitive information during the model's training phase. Our experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed framework not only achieves accuracy levels comparable to conventional methods but also significantly enhances privacy protection. The results underscore the potential of the GAN-Transformer split learning framework as an effective and secure tool in the domain of energy theft detection.</description>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the de facto workhorse for large-scale electronic structure calculations in chemistry and materials science. While plane-wave DFT implementations remain the most widely used, real-space DFT provides advantages in handling complex boundary conditions and scaling to very large systems by allowing for the efficient use of large-scale supercomputers and linear-scaling methods that circumvent the cubic scaling bottleneck. The SPARC-X project (https://github.com/SPARC-X) provides highly efficient and portable real-space DFT codes for a wide range of first principle applications, available in both Matlab (M-SPARC) and C/C++ (SPARC). The rapid growth of SPARC's feature set has created the need for a fully functional interface to drive SPARC in high-throughput calculations. Here we introduce SPARC-X-API, a Python package designed to bridge the SPARC-X project with broader computational frameworks. Built on the atomic simulation environment (ASE) standard, the SPARC-X-API allows users to handle SPARC file formats and run SPARC calculations through the same interface as with other ASE-compatible DFT packages. Beyond standard ASE capabilities, SPARC-X-API provides additional features including 1) support of SPARC-specific setups, including complex boundary conditions and unit conversion, 2) a JSON schema parsed from SPARC's documentation for parameter validation and compatibility checks, and 3) a comprehensive socket communication layer derived from the i-PI protocol facilitating message passing between low-level C code and the Python interface. The goal of the SPARC-X-API is to provide an easy-to-use interface for users with diverse needs and levels of expertise, allowing for minimal effort in adapting SPARC to existing computational workflows, while also supporting developers of advanced real-space methods.</description>

      <title>Pixel-aligned RGB-NIR Stereo Imaging and Dataset for Robot Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating RGB and NIR stereo imaging provides complementary spectral information, potentially enhancing robotic 3D vision in challenging lighting conditions. However, existing datasets and imaging systems lack pixel-level alignment between RGB and NIR images, posing challenges for downstream vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce a robotic vision system equipped with pixel-aligned RGB-NIR stereo cameras and a LiDAR sensor mounted on a mobile robot. The system simultaneously captures pixel-aligned pairs of RGB stereo images, NIR stereo images, and temporally synchronized LiDAR points. Utilizing the mobility of the robot, we present a dataset containing continuous video frames under diverse lighting conditions. We then introduce two methods that utilize the pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images: an RGB-NIR image fusion method and a feature fusion method. The first approach enables existing RGB-pretrained vision models to directly utilize RGB-NIR information without fine-tuning. The second approach fine-tunes existing vision models to more effectively utilize RGB-NIR information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images across diverse lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Linearly scalable fast direct solver based on proxy surface method for two-dimensional elastic wave scattering by cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an $O(N)$ fast direct solver for two-dimensional elastic wave scattering problems. The proxy surface method is extended to elastodynamics to obtain shared coefficients for low-rank approximations from discretized integral operators. The proposed method is a variant of the Martinsson-Rokhlin-type fast direct solver. Our variant avoids the explicit computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix, thereby reducing the required number of matrix-matrix multiplications. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed solver has a complexity of $O(N)$ in the low-frequency range and has a highly parallel computation efficiency with a strong scaling efficiency of 70\%. Furthermore, multiple right-hand sides can be solved efficiently; specifically, when solving problems with 180 right-hand side vectors, the processing time per vector from the second vector onward was approximately 28,900 times faster than that for the first vector. This is a key advantage of fast direct methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Robotic-based Multi-factor Authentication Scheme for Secure Automated Delivery System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Package delivery is a critical aspect of various industries, but it often incurs high financial costs and inefficiencies when relying solely on human resources. The last-mile transport problem, in particular, contributes significantly to the expenditure of human resources in major companies. Robot-based delivery systems have emerged as a potential solution for last-mile delivery to address this challenge. However, robotic delivery systems still face security and privacy issues, like impersonation, replay, man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM), unlinkability, and identity theft. In this context, we propose a privacy-preserving multi-factor authentication scheme specifically designed for robot delivery systems. Additionally, AI-assisted robotic delivery systems are susceptible to machine learning-based attacks (e.g. FGSM, PGD, etc.). We introduce the \emph{first} transformer-based audio-visual fusion defender to tackle this issue, which effectively provides resilience against adversarial samples. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous formal analysis of the proposed protocol and also analyse the protocol security using a popular symbolic proof tool called ProVerif and Scyther. Finally, we present a real-world implementation of the proposed robotic system with the computation cost and energy consumption analysis.

      <title>Improved Parallel Derandomization via Finite Automata with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One main genre of algorithmic derandomization comes from the construction of probability distributions with small support that fool a randomized algorithm. This is especially well-suited to parallelization, i.e. NC algorithms. A significant abstraction of these methods can be formulated in terms of fooling polynomial-space statistical tests computed via finite automata (Sivakumar 2002); this encompasses $k$-wise independence, sums of random variables, and many other properties.
  We describe new parallel algorithms to fool general finite-state automata with significantly reduced processor complexity. The analysis is also simplified because we can cleanly separate the problem-specific optimizations from the general lattice discrepancy problems at the core of the automaton-fooling construction. We illustrate with improved applications to the Gale-Berlekamp Switching Game and to approximate MAX-CUT via SDP rounding.</description>

      <title>Even More On Twisted $A_{2n}$ Class-S Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our investigation into the Coulomb branches of twisted $A_{2n}$ of class-S. In arXiv:2411.17675, we found predictions for the contributions of twisted punctures to the graded dimensions of the Coulomb branch, based on the behaviour under nilpotent Higgsings and S-duality. While surprisingly powerful, these arguments were indirect. Here, we take a different approach: we define precisely the nature of the automorphism under which the twisted punctures are twisted (in particular, it is order-4, not order-2). From that, we find the local constraints satisfied by the Laurent coefficients of the invariant polynomials in the Higgs field, for all twisted punctures in $A_{2n}$, for all n. A crucial role is played by a new (at least, new in physics) order-reversing map on the set of nilpotent orbits in sp(n). Finally, we construct several examples of Seiberg-Witten curves for 3-punctured spheres in these theories.</description>

      <title>LISA test-mass charging. Particle flux modeling, Monte Carlo simulations and induced effects on the sensitivity of the observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The LISA space observatory will explore the sub-Hz spectrum of gravitational wave emission from the Universe. The space environment, where will be immersed in, is responsible for charge accumulation on its free falling test masses (TMs) due to the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEP) impinging on the spacecraft. Primary and secondary particles produced in the spacecraft material eventually reach the TMs by depositing a net positive charge fluctuating in time. This work is relevant for any present and future space missions that, like LISA, host free-falling TMs as inertial reference. Aims. The coupling of the TM charge with native stray electrostatic field produces noise forces on the TMs, which can limit the performance of the LISA mission. A precise knowledge of the charging process allows us to predict the intensity of these charge-induced disturbances and to design specific counter-measures. Methods. We present a comprehensive toolkit that allows us to calculate the TM charging time-series in a geometry representative of LISA mission, and the associated induced forces under different conditions of the space environment by considering the effects of short, long GCR flux modulations and SEPs. Results. We study, for each of the previously mentioned conditions, the impact of spurious forces associated with the TM charging process on the mission sensitivity for gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Pressure Dependence of Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in Excitonic Insulator Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator (EI) phase is a consequence of collective many-body effects where an optical band gap is formed by the condensation of electron-hole pairs or excitons. We report pressure-dependent optical pump optical probe spectroscopy of EI Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ in an on-site in situ geometry. The fast relaxation process depicts the transition across P$_{C_1}$ $\sim$1 GPa from EI phase to a semiconductor and P$_{C_2}$ $\sim$3 GPa from a semiconductor to a semimetallic phase. The instability of the EI phase beyond P$_{C_1}$ is captured by the Rothwarf-Taylor model by incorporating the decrease of the bandgap under pressure. The pressure coefficient of the bandgap decreases, 65 meV/GPa closely agrees with the first principle calculations.</description>

      <title>A Uniformly Most Powerful Unbiased Test for Regression Parameters by Orthogonalizing Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multiple regression model where features (predictors) form an orthonormal basis, we prove that there exists a uniformly most powerful unbiased (UMPU) test for testing that the coefficient of a single feature is negative (or zero) versus positive. The test statistic used is the same as the coefficient t-test commonly reported by standard statistical software, and has the same null distribution. This result suggests that orthogonalizing features around the predictor of interest, prior to fitting the multiple regression, might be a way to increase power in single coefficient testing, compared to regressing on the raw, correlated features. This paper determines the conditions under which this is true, and argues that those conditions are fulfilled in a majority of applications.</description>

      <title>Selective synthesis of large-area monolayer tin sulfide from simple substances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both tin monosulfide (SnS) and tin disulfide (SnS2) are thermodynamically stable layered materials with potential for spin-valleytronic devices and photodetectors. Notably, monolayer SnS, owing to its low symmetry, exhibits interesting properties such as ferroelectricity, shift-current, and a persistent spin helix state in the monolayer limit. However, creating atomic-thickness crystals of SnS is challenging owing to the enhanced interlayer interactions caused by lone pair electrons, unlike to SnS2. Here, we demonstrate that p-type SnS can be selectively grown by simply varying the sulfur vapor concentration relative to tin using single-element precursors. We show that monolayer SnS crystals, up to several tens of micrometers in lateral scale, can be easily and safely obtained by high-temperature etching of bulk SnS in a pure nitrogen gas atmosphere. These findings pave the way for device applications based on high-quality tin sulfide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief review on the formation and evolution of hydrogen deficient central stars of planetary nebulae. We include a detailed description of the main observable features of both the central stars and their surrounding nebulae and review their main classifications. We also provide a brief description of the possible progenitor systems of hydrogen deficient central stars, as well as, of transients closely connected to the formation of these stars. In particular we offer a detailed theoretical explanation of the main evolutionary scenarios, both single and binary, devised to explain these stars and nebulae. Particular emphasis is made in the description of the so-called born again scenario, their quantitative predictions and uncertainties. Finally we discuss the pros and cons of both binary and single evolution channels, draw some conclusions and discuss open questions in the field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, DiVincenzo {\it et al}. put forward the question that whether there exists an unextendible product basis (UPB) which is an uncompletable product basis (UCPB) in every bipartition [\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-003-0877-6}{DiVincenzo {\it et al}. Commun. Math. Phys. \textbf{238}, 379-410(2003)}]. Recently, Shi {\it et al}. presented a UPB in tripartite systems that is also a strongly uncompletable product basis (SUCPB) in every bipartition [\href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac9e14}{Shi {\it et al}. New J. Phys. \textbf{24}, 113-025 (2022)}]. However, whether there exist UPBs that are SUCPBs in only one or two bipartitions remains unknown. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of SUCPBs based on a quasi U-tile structure. We analyze all possible cases about the relationship between UPBs and SUCPBs in tripartite systems. In particular, we construct a UPB with smaller size $d^3-3d^2+1$ in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$, which is an SUCPB in every bipartition and has a smaller cardinality than the existing one.</description>

      <title>Normative Feeling: Socially Patterned Affective Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Norms and the normative processes that enforce them such as social maintenance are considered fundamental building blocks of human societies, shaping many aspects of our cognition. However, emerging work argues that the building blocks of normativity emerged much earlier in evolution than previously considered. In light of this, we argue that normative processes must be taken into account to consider the evolution of even ancient processes such as affect. We show through an agent-based model (with an evolvable model of affect) that different affective dispositions emerge when taking into account social maintenance. In this paper we demonstrate that social maintenance results in the emergence of a minimal population regulation mechanism in a dynamic environment, without the need to predict the state of the environment or reason about the mental state of others. We use a cultural interpretation of our model to derive a new definition of norm emergence which distinguishes between indirect and direct social maintenance. Indirect social maintenance tends to one equilibrium (similar to environmental scaffolding) and the richer direct social maintenance results in many possible equilibria in behaviour, capturing an important aspect of normative behaviour in that it bears a certain degree of arbitrariness. We also distinguish between single-variable and mechanistic normative regularities. A mechanistic regularity rather than a particular behaviour specified by one value e.g. walking speed, its a collection of values that specify a culturally patterned version of a psychological mechanism e.g. a disposition. This is how culture reprograms entire cognitive and physiological systems.</description>

      <title>VLM-HOI: Vision Language Models for Interpretable Human-Object Interaction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Vision Language Model (VLM) has recently addressed remarkable progress in bridging two fundamental modalities. VLM, trained by a sufficiently large dataset, exhibits a comprehensive understanding of both visual and linguistic to perform diverse tasks. To distill this knowledge accurately, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach that explicitly utilizes VLM as an objective function form for the Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection task (\textbf{VLM-HOI}). Specifically, we propose a method that quantifies the similarity of the predicted HOI triplet using the Image-Text matching technique. We represent HOI triplets linguistically to fully utilize the language comprehension of VLMs, which are more suitable than CLIP models due to their localization and object-centric nature. This matching score is used as an objective for contrastive optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first utilization of VLM language abilities for HOI detection. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art HOI detection accuracy on benchmarks. We believe integrating VLMs into HOI detection represents important progress towards more advanced and interpretable analysis of human-object interactions.</description>

We argue that in the presence of a large enough Chern-Simons coupling the quasi normal modes of the brane will have a diminishing imaginary part. Since our result is agnostic to the matter content of the theory it implies that, generically, the boundary theory will possess long lived modes which should be observable in a proper setting.</description>

      <title>A New Rarity Assessment of the `Disk of Satellites': the Milky Way System Is the Exception Rather than the Rule in the $\Lambda$CDM Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) show disk-like distributions (the disk of satellites; DoS), which is a small-scale problem of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The conventional definition of the MW-like DoS is a satellite system with a minor-to-major axis ratio ($c$/$a$) lower than the MW's $c$/$a$ value of 0.181. Here we question the validity of the $c$/$a$-based DoS rarity assessment and propose an alternative approach. How satellites are placed around a galaxy is dictated mainly by two factors: the distributions of satellites' orbital poles and distances from the host. Based on this premise, we construct the `satellite distribution generator' code and generate 10$^5$ `spatially and kinematically analogous systems (SKASs)' sharing these two factors. The SKAS can disclose the intrinsic, underlying $c$/$a$ probability distribution function (PDF), from which a present-day $c$/$a$ value is fortuitously determined. We find that the $c$/$a$ PDF of the MW DoS defined by 11 classical satellites is quite broad ($\sigma_{c/a}$$\sim$0.105), implying that a simple present-day $c$/$a$ value, combined with its highly time-variable nature, cannot fully represent the degree of flatness. Moreover, based on the intrinsic $c$/$a$ PDF, we re-evaluate the rarity of the MW DoS by comparing it with IllustrisTNG50-1 host-satellite systems and find that even with the new measure, the MW DoS remains rare (0.00$\sim$3.40%). We show that the reason behind the rareness is that both orbital poles and distances of the 11 MW satellites are far more plane-friendly than those of simulated host-satellite systems, challenging the current structure and galaxy formation model.</description>

      <title>Disentangling morphology and conductance in amorphous graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>

      <title>HyperGLM: HyperGraph for Video Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs have advanced vision-language tasks but still struggle with understanding video scenes. To bridge this gap, Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) has emerged to capture multi-object relationships across video frames. However, prior methods rely on pairwise connections, limiting their ability to handle complex multi-object interactions and reasoning. To this end, we propose Multimodal LLMs on a Scene HyperGraph (HyperGLM), promoting reasoning about multi-way interactions and higher-order relationships. Our approach uniquely integrates entity scene graphs, which capture spatial relationships between objects, with a procedural graph that models their causal transitions, forming a unified HyperGraph. Significantly, HyperGLM enables reasoning by injecting this unified HyperGraph into LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a new Video Scene Graph Reasoning (VSGR) dataset featuring 1.9M frames from third-person, egocentric, and drone views and supports five tasks: Scene Graph Generation, Scene Graph Anticipation, Video Question Answering, Video Captioning, and Relation Reasoning. Empirically, HyperGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five tasks, effectively modeling and reasoning complex relationships in diverse video scenes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Relationships of Subjects and Shapelets for Semi-supervised Multivariate Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution along the AGB as revealed by the shape of Miras' visual light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new analysis of a sample of visual light curves of Long Period Variable (LPV) Mira stars is presented. The curves cover the past four decades and are selected from the AAVSO data base as including a very large number of high-density and high-quality observations. The aim of the analysis is to offer a more precise, more quantitative and more systematic picture than available from earlier studies. The results corroborate earlier descriptions and reveal new correlations between the shapes of the light curves and the time spent by the star on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A family of nearly sinusoidal curves, associated with M-type spectral types and displaying no sign of having entered the thermally-pulsing phase (TP-AGB) is identified with good confidence. All other curves are clearly distinct from this family and usually start departing from it by displaying a broader luminosity minimum, implying a slowing down of the rate of luminosity increase on the ascending branch. This slowing down feature, referred to as a hump, spans across the ascending branch as the spectral-type of the star evolves from M to C. It may go all the way to maximal light or stop earlier, covering only part of the ascending branch. While this general average trend is established with good confidence, deviations from it cause a significant scatter of the parameters defining the shapes of the curves. Comments aimed at shedding light on the underlying physics are presented together with speculative interpretations, in the hope that they could encourage and inspire new studies, in particular based on simulations using state-of-the-art models of the inner star dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-1/2 triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangular lattice antiferromagnets are prototypes for frustrated magnetism and may potentially realize novel quantum magnetic states such as a quantum spin liquid ground state. A recent work suggests NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with rare-earth triangular lattice is a quantum spin liquid candidate and highlights the large family of rare-earth heptatantalates as a framework for quantum magnetism investigation. In this paper, we report the structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$. Both compounds are isostructural to NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with no detectable structural disorder. For CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the crystal field energy levels and parameters are determined by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Based on the crystal field result, the magnetic susceptibility data could be well fitted and explained, which reveals that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a highly anisotropic Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet ($g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$3) with very weak exchange interaction (J$\sim$0.22~K). For YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$, millimeter sized single crystals could be grown. The anisotropic magnetization and electron spin resonance data show that YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ has a contrasting in-plane magnetic anisotropy with $g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$0.67 similar as that of YbMgGaO$_4$. The above results indicate that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with pseudospin-1/2 ground states might either be quantum spin liquid candidate materials or find applications in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration due to the weak exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- III: Long term evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. QPEs have shown to be invaluable in probing the orbits of SMOs in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this paper, we extend previous orbital analyses in Refs. arXiv:2401.11190, arXiv:2405.06429 by including extra effects, the SMO orbital decay due to collisions with the disk and the disk precession. We find clear Bayes evidence for orbital decay in GSN 069 and for disk precession in eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources. The detection of these effects provides informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. With tighter constraints on the SMO orbital parameters, we further confirm that these two QPE EMRIs are nearly circular orbiters which are consistent with the wet EMRI formation channel prediction, but are incompatible with either the dry loss-cone channel or the Hills mechanism. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>

      <title>The Trusted Caregiver: The Influence of Eye and Mouth Design Incorporating the Baby Schema Effect in Virtual Humanoid Agents on Older Adults Users' Perception of Trustworthiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing proportion of the older adult population has made the smart home care industry one of the critical markets for virtual human-like agents. It is crucial to effectively promote a trustworthy human-computer partnership with older adults, enhancing service acceptance and effectiveness. However, few studies have focused on the facial features of the agents themselves, where the "baby schema" effect plays a vital role in enhancing trustworthiness. The eyes and mouth, in particular, attract most of the audience's attention and are especially significant. This study explores the impact of eye and mouth design on users' perception of trustworthiness. Specifically, a virtual humanoid agents model was developed, and based on this, 729 virtual facial images of children were designed. Participants (N=162) were asked to evaluate the impact of variations in the size and positioning of the eyes and mouth regions on the perceived credibility of these virtual agents. The results revealed that when the facial aspect ratio (width and height denoted as W and H, respectively) aligned with the "baby schema" effect (eye size at 0.25W, mouth size at 0.27W, eye height at 0.64H, eye distance at 0.43W, mouth height at 0.74H, and smile arc at 0.043H), the virtual agents achieved the highest facial credibility. This study proposes a design paradigm for the main facial features of virtual humanoid agents, which can increase the trust of older adults during interactions and significantly contribute to the research on the trustworthiness of virtual humanoid agents.</description>

      <title>MeltpoolINR: Predicting temperature field, melt pool geometry, and their rate of change in laser powder bed fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven, differentiable neural network model designed to learn the temperature field, its gradient, and the cooling rate, while implicitly representing the melt pool boundary as a level set in laser powder bed fusion. The physics-guided model combines fully connected feed-forward neural networks with Fourier feature encoding of the spatial coordinates and laser position. Notably, our differentiable model allows for the computation of temperature derivatives with respect to position, time, and process parameters using autodifferentiation. Moreover, the implicit neural representation of the melt pool boundary as a level set enables the inference of the solidification rate and the rate of change in melt pool geometry relative to process parameters. The model is trained to learn the top view of the temperature field and its spatiotemporal derivatives during a single-track laser powder bed fusion process, as a function of three process parameters, using data from high-fidelity thermo-fluid simulations. The model accuracy is evaluated and compared to a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model, demonstrating strong generalization ability and close agreement with high-fidelity data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of web articles engage the reader with the feeling of being immersed in the data space. However, the exact characteristics of spatial immersion in the context of visual storytelling remain vague. For example, what are the common design patterns of data stories with spatial immersion? How do they affect the reader's experience? To gain a deeper understanding of the subject, we collected 23 distinct data stories with spatial immersion, and identified six design patterns, such as cinematic camera shots and transitions, intuitive data representations, realism, naturally moving elements, direct manipulation of camera or visualization, and dynamic dimension. Subsequently, we designed four data stories and conducted a crowdsourced user study comparing three design variations (static, animated, and immersive). Our results suggest that data stories with the design patterns for spatial immersion are more interesting and persuasive than static or animated ones, but no single condition was deemed more understandable or trustworthy.</description>

      <title>RL for Mitigating Cascading Failures: Targeted Exploration via Sensitivity Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity grid's resiliency and climate change strongly impact one another due to an array of technical and policy-related decisions that impact both. This paper introduces a physics-informed machine learning-based framework to enhance grid's resiliency. Specifically, when encountering disruptive events, this paper designs remedial control actions to prevent blackouts. The proposed Physics-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PG-RL) framework determines effective real-time remedial line-switching actions, considering their impact on power balance, system security, and grid reliability. To identify an effective blackout mitigation policy, PG-RL leverages power-flow sensitivity factors to guide the RL exploration during agent training. Comprehensive evaluations using the Grid2Op platform demonstrate that incorporating physical signals into RL significantly improves resource utilization within electric grids and achieves better blackout mitigation policies - both of which are critical in addressing climate change.</description>

      <title>de Broglie scale time delays in pulsar networks for ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of ultralight dark matter helps constrain the lower bound on minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales similar to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay and gravitational redshift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Space-borne Interferometers to Detect Thousands of Memory Signals Emitted by Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational memory effect manifests the nonlinearity of the gravitation, reflects the degenerate gravitational vacua, and indicates the types of the asymptotic symmetries. However, by the received wisdom, it would be challenging to detect it. In this Letter, we envisioned employing the space-borne interferometer, especially DECIGO, to detect memory signals generated by the stellar-mass binary black hole (BBHs) systems, the conventional targets of the ground-based detectors. We estimated that during its 5 years' observation, DECIGO could detect nearly 2,258 loud enough memory signals. Among them, 102 have signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8. Our prediction was obtained with the BBH population model constrained by the recent gravitational wave observations in GWTC-3. The Power Law + Peak mass model and the DEFAULT spin model were employed, and the merger rate was chosen to be proportional to the Madau-Dickinson formation rate. In the analysis, the impact of the orbital eccentricity was also considered. The high rate is due to the sufficiently strong memory signal right at the bandwidth of DECIGO, and also because of the humongous number of the surely existing stellar-mass BBHs. The substantial, and yet conservative, number of detections enables to leverage statistical approaches to harness the memory effect for fundamental physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Using different sources of ground truths and transfer learning to improve the generalization of photometric redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore methods to improve galaxy redshift predictions by combining different ground truths. Traditional machine learning models rely on training sets with known spectroscopic redshifts, which are precise but only represent a limited sample of galaxies. To make redshift models more generalizable to the broader galaxy population, we investigate transfer learning and directly combining ground truth redshifts derived from photometry and spectroscopy. We use the COSMOS2020 survey to create a dataset, TransferZ, which includes photometric redshift estimates derived from up to 35 imaging filters using template fitting. This dataset spans a wider range of galaxy types and colors compared to spectroscopic samples, though its redshift estimates are less accurate. We first train a base neural network on TransferZ and then refine it using transfer learning on a dataset of galaxies with more precise spectroscopic redshifts (GalaxiesML). In addition, we train a neural network on a combined dataset of TransferZ and GalaxiesML. Both methods reduce bias by $\sim$ 5x, RMS error by $\sim$ 1.5x, and catastrophic outlier rates by 1.3x on GalaxiesML, compared to a baseline trained only on TransferZ. However, we also find a reduction in performance for RMS and bias when evaluated on TransferZ data. Overall, our results demonstrate these approaches can meet cosmological requirements.</description>

      <title>FAMES: Fast Approximate Multiplier Substitution for Mixed-Precision Quantized DNNs--Down to 2 Bits!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.</description>

      <title>SymTFT Approach to 2D Orbifold Groupoids: `t Hooft Anomalies, Gauging, and Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the 3D SymTFT approach to study the generalized symmetries and partition functions of 2D CFTs in various orbifolded and fermionic phases. These phases can be realized by the sandwich construction in the associated 3D SymTFTs with different gaped boundaries that encode the data of symmetries in the 2D CFTs. We demonstrate that the gaped boundaries can all be identified with the (fermionic) Lagrangian algebra in the 3D SymTFT, and thus use them to establish webs of dualities of the boundary CFTs in different phases on the level of partition functions. In addition, we introduce the concept of ``para-fermionic Lagrangian algebra" which enables us to construct the partition functions of para-fermionized CFTs on the 2D boundary. Finally, we provide many important examples, including a 3D SymTFT viewpoint on gauging non-invertible symmetries in 2D CFTs.</description>

      <title>Impact of tensor forces on quasifission product yield distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory to study the 48Ca+249Bk and 48Ti+238U systems, taking into account the dependence on orientation for deformed nuclei and full range of impact parameters. By analyzing fragment distributions of neutron and proton numbers, we assess the influence of different isoscalar and isovector tensor coupling constants of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. The quasifission yield distributions of 48Ca + 249Bk collision system utilizing SLy5t and T31 parametrizations exhibit more pronounced spherical shell effects compared to those using SLy5, T44 and T62 sets. Furthermore, within each parametrization group, the distributions for SLy5t and T31 are closely aligned, as are those for SLy5, T44, and T62. Similarly, the yield distributions for the 48Ti + 238U system using SLy5t and T31 also reflect the more pronounced spherical shell effects relative to SLy5 and T62, while the charge distribution shows much better agreement with experimental results for the SLy5t and T62 parametrizations compared to SLy5 and T31. The yield distributions for the 48Ca+249Bk and 48Ti+238U systems, when compared across the SLy5, SLy5t, T31, T44, and T62 parametrizations, indicate that the influence of tensor forces on quasifission fragments is reflected in the prominence of shell effects. This influence appears to be sensitive only in specific regions within the isoscalar and isovector coupling constant parameter space. In the 48Ti + 238U system, the prominence of shell effects is manifested not only through shifts in peak positions but also through narrower yield distributions.</description>

      <title>Systematic effects in the lattice calculation of inclusive semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the calculation of the inclusive semileptonic decay of the $D_s$ meson on the lattice. We simulate the $D_s \rightarrow X_s\ell\nu_\ell$ process with M\"obius domain-wall charm and strange quarks, whose masses are approximately tuned to their physical values. Our simulations cover the whole kinematical region. The focus of this work is to present updates on our strategies towards estimating the systematic uncertainties in the determination of the inclusive decay rate. We specifically focus on the systematic errors due to the choice of our approximation strategy and finite-volume effects.</description>

      <title>Singular bifurcations in a slow-fast modified Leslie-Gower model with Holling type II functional response, weak Allee effect and a generalist predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a predator-prey system with a generalist Leslie-Gower predator, a functional Holling type II response, and a weak Allee effect on the prey. The prey's population often grows much faster than its predator, allowing us to introduce a small time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ that relates the growth rates of both species, giving rise to a slow-fast system. Zhu and Liu (2022) show that, in the case of the weak Allee effect, Hopf singular bifurcation, slow-fast canard cycles, relaxation oscillations, etc., exist. Our main contribution lies in the rigorous analysis of a degenerate scenario organized by a (degenerate) transcritical bifurcation. The key tool employed is the blow-up method that desingularizes the degenerate singularity. In addition, we determine the criticality of the singular Hopf bifurcation using recent intrinsic techniques that do not require a local normal form. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical bifurcation analysis, in which we numerically identify and analytically confirm the existence of a nearby Takens-Bogdanov point.</description>

      <title>ORIS: Online Active Learning Using Reinforcement Learning-based Inclusive Sampling for Robust Streaming Analytics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective labeled data collection plays a critical role in developing and fine-tuning robust streaming analytics systems. However, continuously labeling documents to filter relevant information poses significant challenges like limited labeling budget or lack of high-quality labels. There is a need for efficient human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITL-ML) design to improve streaming analytics systems. One particular HITL- ML approach is online active learning, which involves iteratively selecting a small set of the most informative documents for labeling to enhance the ML model performance. The performance of such algorithms can get affected due to human errors in labeling. To address these challenges, we propose ORIS, a method to perform Online active learning using Reinforcement learning-based Inclusive Sampling of documents for labeling. ORIS aims to create a novel Deep Q-Network-based strategy to sample incoming documents that minimize human errors in labeling and enhance the ML model performance. We evaluate the ORIS method on emotion recognition tasks, and it outperforms traditional baselines in terms of both human labeling performance and the ML model performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Gaze Estimation Via Unidirectional Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using lightweight models as backbone networks in gaze estimation tasks often results in significant performance degradation. The main reason is that the number of feature channels in lightweight networks is usually small, which makes the model expression ability limited. In order to improve the performance of lightweight models in gaze estimation tasks, a network model named Multitask-Gaze is proposed. The main components of Multitask-Gaze include Unidirectional Convolution (UC), Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA), Global Convolution Module (GCM), and Multi-task Regression Module(MRM). UC not only significantly reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs, but also extends the receptive field and improves the long-distance modeling capability of the model, thereby improving the model performance. SCA highlights gaze-related features and suppresses gaze-irrelevant features. The GCM replaces the pooling layer and avoids the performance degradation due to information loss. MRM improves the accuracy of individual tasks and strengthens the connections between tasks for overall performance improvement. The experimental results show that compared with the State-of-the-art method SUGE, the performance of Multitask-Gaze on MPIIFaceGaze and Gaze360 datasets is improved by 1.71% and 2.75%, respectively, while the number of parameters and FLOPs are significantly reduced by 75.5% and 86.88%.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we study a holographic diffeomorphism invariant higher-derivative extension of Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend (BHT) cosmological gravity in the context of Wald's formalism. We calculate the entropy, mass and angular momentum of warped anti-de Sitter (WAdS$_3$) black holes in ghost-free BHT massive gravity and its extension using the covariant phase space method. We also compute the central charges of the dual boundary conformal field theories (CFT) from the thermodynamics method.</description>

      <title>Mortality Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism Patients with Deep Learning and XGBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a serious cardiovascular condition that remains a leading cause of mortality and critical illness, underscoring the need for enhanced diagnostic strategies. Conventional clinical methods have limited success in predicting 30-day in-hospital mortality of PE patients. In this study, we present a new algorithm, called PEP-Net, for 30-day mortality prediction of PE patients based on the initial imaging data (CT) that opportunistically integrates a 3D Residual Network (3DResNet) with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with patient level binary labels without annotations of the emboli and its extent. Our proposed system offers a comprehensive prediction strategy by handling class imbalance problems, reducing overfitting via regularization, and reducing the prediction variance for more stable predictions. PEP-Net was tested in a cohort of 193 volumetric CT scans diagnosed with Acute PE, and it demonstrated a superior performance by significantly outperforming baseline models (76-78\%) with an accuracy of 94.5\% (+/-0.3) and 94.0\% (+/-0.7) when the input image is either lung region (Lung-ROI) or heart region (Cardiac-ROI). Our results advance PE prognostics by using only initial imaging data, setting a new benchmark in the field. While purely deep learning models have become the go-to for many medical classification (diagnostic) tasks, combined ResNet and XGBoost models herein outperform sole deep learning models due to a potential reason for having lack of enough data.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Gaze Estimation Model Via Fusion Global Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based appearance gaze estimation methods are gaining popularity due to their high accuracy and fewer constraints from the environment. However, existing high-precision models often rely on deeper networks, leading to problems such as large parameters, long training time, and slow convergence. In terms of this issue, this paper proposes a novel lightweight gaze estimation model FGI-Net(Fusion Global Information). The model fuses global information into the CNN, effectively compensating for the need of multi-layer convolution and pooling to indirectly capture global information, while reducing the complexity of the model, improving the model accuracy and convergence speed. To validate the performance of the model, a large number of experiments are conducted, comparing accuracy with existing classical models and lightweight models, comparing convergence speed with models of different architectures, and conducting ablation experiments. Experimental results show that compared with GazeCaps, the latest gaze estimation model, FGI-Net achieves a smaller angle error with 87.1% and 79.1% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, respectively (MPIIFaceGaze is 3.74{\deg}, EyeDiap is 5.15{\deg}, Gaze360 is 10.50{\deg} and RT-Gene is 6.02{\deg}). Moreover, compared with different architectural models such as CNN and Transformer, FGI-Net is able to quickly converge to a higher accuracy range with fewer iterations of training, when achieving optimal accuracy on the Gaze360 and EyeDiap datasets, the FGI-Net model has 25% and 37.5% fewer iterations of training compared to GazeTR, respectively.</description>

      <title>FlexiBit: Fully Flexible Precision Bit-parallel Accelerator Architecture for Arbitrary Mixed Precision AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can utilize low-precision floating point (FP) quantization to deliver high efficiency while maintaining original model accuracy. In particular, recent works have shown the effectiveness of non-power-of-two precisions, such as FP6 and FP5, and diverse sensitivity to low-precision arithmetic of LLM layers, which motivates mixed precision arithmetic including non-power-of-two precisions in LLMs. Although low-precision algorithmically leads to low computational overheads, such benefits cannot be fully exploited due to hardware constraints that support a limited set of power-of-two precisions (e.g., FP8, 16, 32, and 64 in NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core). In addition, the hardware compute units are designed to support standard formats (e.g., E4M3 and E5M2 for FP8). Such practices require re-designing the hardware whenever new precision and format emerge, which leads to high hardware replacement costs to exploit the benefits of new precisions and formats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new accelerator architecture, FlexiBit, which efficiently supports FP and INT arithmetic in arbitrary precisions and formats. Unlike previous bit-serial designs, which also provide flexibility but at the cost of performance due to its bit-wise temporal processing nature, FlexiBit's architecture enables bit-parallel processing of any precision and format without compute unit underutilization. FlexiBit's new capability to exploit non-power of two precision and format led to 1.66x and 1.62x higher performance per area on GPT-3 in FP6 targeting a cloud-scale accelerator, compared to a Tensor Core-like architecture and a state-of-the-art bit-parallel flexible precision accelerator, BitFusion, respectively. Also, the bit-parallel nature of FlexiBit's architecture led to 3.9x higher performance/area compared to a state-of-the-art bit-serial architecture.</description>

      <title>GLS: Geometry-aware 3D Language Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved significant performance on indoor surface reconstruction and open-vocabulary segmentation. This paper presents GLS, a unified framework of surface reconstruction and open-vocabulary segmentation based on 3DGS. GLS extends two fields by exploring the correlation between them. For indoor surface reconstruction, we introduce surface normal prior as a geometric cue to guide the rendered normal, and use the normal error to optimize the rendered depth. For open-vocabulary segmentation, we employ 2D CLIP features to guide instance features and utilize DEVA masks to enhance their view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of jointly optimizing surface reconstruction and open-vocabulary segmentation, where GLS surpasses state-of-the-art approaches of each task on MuSHRoom, ScanNet++, and LERF-OVS datasets.

      <title>CAT(0) geometry of complex curve complements and families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of whether braid groups are CAT(0), we investigate the CAT(0) behavior of fundamental groups of plane curve complements and certain universal families. If $C$ is the branch locus of a generic projection of a smooth, complete intersection surface to $\PP^2$, we show that $\pi_1(\PP^2\setminus C)$ is CAT(0). In the other direction, we prove that the fundamental group of the universal family associated with the singularities of type $E_6$, $E_7$, and $E_8$ is not CAT(0).</description>

      <title>PersonaCraft: Personalized Full-Body Image Synthesis for Multiple Identities from Single References Using 3D-Model-Conditioned Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized image generation has been significantly advanced, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images. However, existing methods often struggle with generating images of multiple people due to occlusions and fail to accurately personalize full-body shapes. In this paper, we propose PersonaCraft, a novel approach that combines diffusion models with 3D human modeling to address these limitations. Our method effectively manages occlusions by incorporating 3D-aware pose conditioning with SMPLx-ControlNet and accurately personalizes human full-body shapes through SMPLx fitting. Additionally, PersonaCraft enables user-defined body shape adjustments, adding flexibility for individual body customization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PersonaCraft in generating high-quality, realistic images of multiple individuals while resolving occlusion issues, thus establishing a new standard for multi-person personalized image synthesis.

      <title>Overview of TREC 2024 Biomedical Generative Retrieval (BioGen) Track</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the biomedical domain has seen significant progress and improvement in multiple tasks such as biomedical question answering, lay language summarization of the biomedical literature, clinical note summarization, etc. However, hallucinations or confabulations remain one of the key challenges when using LLMs in the biomedical and other domains. Inaccuracies may be particularly harmful in high-risk situations, such as making clinical decisions or appraising biomedical research. Studies on the evaluation of the LLMs' abilities to ground generated statements in verifiable sources have shown that models perform significantly worse on lay-user generated questions, and often fail to reference relevant sources. This can be problematic when those seeking information want evidence from studies to back up the claims from LLMs[3]. Unsupported statements are a major barrier to using LLMs in any applications that may affect health. Methods for grounding generated statements in reliable sources along with practical evaluation approaches are needed to overcome this barrier. Towards this, in our pilot task organized at TREC 2024, we introduced the task of reference attribution as a means to mitigate the generation of false statements by LLMs answering biomedical questions.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Explainable Solar Flare Forecasting Models with Attribution-based Proximity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable predictions of solar flares are essential due to their potentially significant impact on Earth and space-based infrastructure. Although deep learning models have shown notable predictive capabilities in this domain, current evaluations often focus on accuracy while neglecting interpretability and reliability--factors that are especially critical in operational settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel proximity-based framework for analyzing post hoc explanations to assess the interpretability of deep learning models for solar flare prediction. Our study compares two models trained on full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images to predict $\geq$M-class solar flares within a 24-hour window. We employ the Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) method to generate attribution maps from these models, which we then analyze to gain insights into their decision-making processes. To support the evaluation of explanations in operational systems, we introduce a proximity-based metric that quantitatively assesses the accuracy and relevance of local explanations when regions of interest are known. Our findings indicate that the models' predictions align with active region characteristics to varying degrees, offering valuable insights into their behavior. This framework enhances the evaluation of model interpretability in solar flare forecasting and supports the development of more transparent and reliable operational systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Tabular Datasets through LLMs to Rapidly Explore Hypotheses about Real-World Entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do horror writers have worse childhoods than other writers? Though biographical details are known about many writers, quantitatively exploring such a qualitative hypothesis requires significant human effort, e.g. to sift through many biographies and interviews of writers and to iteratively search for quantitative features that reflect what is qualitatively of interest. This paper explores the potential to quickly prototype these kinds of hypotheses through (1) applying LLMs to estimate properties of concrete entities like specific people, companies, books, kinds of animals, and countries; (2) performing off-the-shelf analysis methods to reveal possible relationships among such properties (e.g. linear regression); and towards further automation, (3) applying LLMs to suggest the quantitative properties themselves that could help ground a particular qualitative hypothesis (e.g. number of adverse childhood events, in the context of the running example). The hope is to allow sifting through hypotheses more quickly through collaboration between human and machine. Our experiments highlight that indeed, LLMs can serve as useful estimators of tabular data about specific entities across a range of domains, and that such estimations improve with model scale. Further, initial experiments demonstrate the potential of LLMs to map a qualitative hypothesis of interest to relevant concrete variables that the LLM can then estimate. The conclusion is that LLMs offer intriguing potential to help illuminate scientifically interesting patterns latent within the internet-scale data they are trained upon.</description>

      <title>SmileSplat: Generalizable Gaussian Splats for Unconstrained Sparse Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Multi-view Images can be Learned to predict explicit radiance fields via Generalizable Gaussian Splatting approaches, which can achieve wider application prospects in real-life when ground-truth camera parameters are not required as inputs. In this paper, a novel generalizable Gaussian Splatting method, SmileSplat, is proposed to reconstruct pixel-aligned Gaussian surfels for diverse scenarios only requiring unconstrained sparse multi-view images. First, Gaussian surfels are predicted based on the multi-head Gaussian regression decoder, which can are represented with less degree-of-freedom but have better multi-view consistency. Furthermore, the normal vectors of Gaussian surfel are enhanced based on high-quality of normal priors. Second, the Gaussians and camera parameters (both extrinsic and intrinsic) are optimized to obtain high-quality Gaussian radiance fields for novel view synthesis tasks based on the proposed Bundle-Adjusting Gaussian Splatting module. Extensive experiments on novel view rendering and depth map prediction tasks are conducted on public datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various 3D vision tasks.

      <title>DuMapper: Towards Automatic Verification of Large-Scale POIs with Street Views at Baidu Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased popularity of mobile devices, Web mapping services have become an indispensable tool in our daily lives. To provide user-satisfied services, such as location searches, the point of interest (POI) database is the fundamental infrastructure, as it archives multimodal information on billions of geographic locations closely related to people's lives, such as a shop or a bank. Therefore, verifying the correctness of a large-scale POI database is vital. To achieve this goal, many industrial companies adopt volunteered geographic information (VGI) platforms that enable thousands of crowdworkers and expert mappers to verify POIs seamlessly; but to do so, they have to spend millions of dollars every year. To save the tremendous labor costs, we devised DuMapper, an automatic system for large-scale POI verification with the multimodal street-view data at Baidu Maps. DuMapper takes the signboard image and the coordinates of a real-world place as input to generate a low-dimensional vector, which can be leveraged by ANN algorithms to conduct a more accurate search through billions of archived POIs in the database for verification within milliseconds. It can significantly increase the throughput of POI verification by $50$ times. DuMapper has already been deployed in production since \DuMPOnline, which dramatically improves the productivity and efficiency of POI verification at Baidu Maps. As of December 31, 2021, it has enacted over $405$ million iterations of POI verification within a 3.5-year period, representing an approximate workload of $800$ high-performance expert mappers.</description>

      <title>Development and experimental validation of an in-house treatment planning system with greedy energy layer optimization for fast IMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) using pencil beam technique scans tumor in a layer by layer, then spot by spot manner. It can provide highly conformal dose to tumor targets and spare nearby organs-at-risk (OAR). Fast delivery of IMPT can improve patient comfort and reduce motion-induced uncertainties. Since energy layer switching time dominants the plan delivery time, reducing the number of energy layers is important for improving delivery efficiency. Although various energy layer optimization (ELO) methods exist, they are rarely experimentally validated or clinically implemented, since it is technically challenging to integrate these methods into commercially available treatment planning system (TPS) that is not open-source. Methods: The dose calculation accuracy of IH-TPS is verified against the measured beam data and the RayStation TPS. For treatment planning, a novel ELO method via greed selection algorithm is proposed to reduce energy layer switching time and total plan delivery time. To validate the planning accuracy of IH-TPS, the 3D gamma index is calculated between IH-TPS plans and RayStation plans for various scenarios. Patient-specific quality-assurance (QA) verifications are conducted to experimentally verify the delivered dose from the IH-TPS plans for several clinical cases. Results: Dose distributions in IH-TPS matched with those from RayStation TPS, with 3D gamma index results exceeding 95% (2mm, 2%). The ELO method significantly reduced the delivery time while maintaining plan quality. For instance, in a brain case, the number of energy layers was reduced from 78 to 40, leading to a 62% reduction in total delivery time. Patient-specific QA validation with the IBA Proteus ONE proton machine confirmed a &gt;95% pass rate for all cases.</description>

      <title>Music2Fail: Transfer Music to Failed Recorder Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of music style transfer is to convert a music performance by one instrument into another while keeping the musical contents unchanged. In this paper, we investigate another style transfer scenario called ``failed-music style transfer''. Unlike the usual music style transfer where the content remains the same and only the instrumental characteristics are changed, this scenario seeks to transfer the music from the source instrument to the target instrument which is deliberately performed off-pitch. Our work attempts to transfer normally played music into off-pitch recorder music, which we call ``failed-style recorder'', and study the results of the conversion. To carry out this work, we have also proposed a dataset of failed-style recorders for this task, called ``FR109 Dataset''. Such an experiment explores the music style transfer task in a more expressive setting, as the generated audio should sound like an ``off-pitch recorder'' while maintaining a certain degree of naturalness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the contribution of the gluonic component of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) to the angular momentum density in various decompositions. We use the light-front Hamiltonian technique, and a two-component formalism in light-front gauge, where the constrained degrees of freedom are eliminated. Instead of a nucleon, we consider a simple composite spin-$1/2$ state, namely a quark dressed with a gluon. We present two dimensional light-front distributions in transverse impact parameter space, and compare the different angular momentum decompositions at the density level. Incorporating also the contribution coming from the quark part of the EMT, we verify the spin sum rule for such a state.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit Layer-Discriminative KV Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Dual-Level Boost Network for Long-Tail Prohibited Items Detection in X-ray Security Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of prohibited items in X-ray security inspections is vital for ensuring public safety. However, the long-tail distribution of item categories, where certain prohibited items are far less common, poses a big challenge for detection models, as rare categories often lack sufficient training data. Existing methods struggle to classify these rare items accurately due to this imbalance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Boost Network (DBNet) specifically designed to overcome these challenges in X-ray security screening. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a specific data augmentation strategy employing Poisson blending, inspired by the characteristics of X-ray images, to generate realistic synthetic instances of rare items which can effectively mitigate data imbalance; and (2) a context-aware feature enhancement module that captures the spatial and semantic interactions between objects and their surroundings, enhancing classification accuracy for underrepresented categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DBNet improves detection performance for tail categories, outperforming sota methods in X-ray security inspection scenarios by a large margin 17.2%, thereby ensuring enhanced public safety.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nuclear momentum anisotropy based on intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate ultra-central collisions of prolate uranium-uranium nuclei at intermediate energies using the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck model to investigate the impact of momentum anisotropy on spatial geometric effects. By defining the quadrupole deformation parameter in momentum space $\beta_\text{p}$, we establish an ellipsoidal Fermi surface, aligning its rotational symmetry axis with the one in coordinate space. It is found that oblate momentum density enhances elliptic flow $v_2$, while prolate momentum density has the opposite effect, particularly pronounced in the outer, high transverse momentum $p_\text{t}$ region. Momentum anisotropy also causes differences in the initial momentum mean projection along the beam direction, with larger projections producing more pion mesons. Additionally, significant effects on mean square elliptic flow are observed in non-polarized collisions. We further examine the relationship between the $v_2$-$p_\text{t}$ slope and $\beta_\text{p}$, eliminating systematic errors through the two-system ratio. These findings provide important references for experimentalists in heavy-ion collisions and valuable feedback to theorists regarding nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Hadron production in the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged current weak interaction can distinguish quark flavors, it provides a valid method to determine (transverse momentum dependent) parton distribution functions in high energy reactions by utilizing tagged hadrons. In this paper, we calculate the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei. Semi-inclusive means that a spin-1 hadron is also measured in addition to the scattered charged lepton. The target nucleus has the same number of neutrons and protons and is assumed as unpolarized. According to calculations, we find that only chiral-even terms survive and chiral-odd terms vanish in the differential cross section for this charged current deeply inelastic (anti-)neutrino nucleus scattering process. Furthermore, we introduce a universal measurable quantity, the yield asymmetry of the produced hadron $A^h$, to determine the muclear transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. Numerical estimates show that the yield asymmetry is independent of the type of target nucleus if it has the same number of neutrons and protons. Numerical estimates also show that the isospin symmetry works very successfully in the $N=Z$ nuclei and sea quark distribution functions and disfavored fragmentation functions have significant influence on measurable quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To detect prohibited items in challenging categories, human inspectors typically rely on images from two distinct views (vertical and side). Can AI detect prohibited items from dual-view X-ray images in the same way humans do? Existing X-ray datasets often suffer from limitations, such as single-view imaging or insufficient sample diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce the Large-scale Dual-view X-ray (LDXray), which consists of 353,646 instances across 12 categories, providing a diverse and comprehensive resource for training and evaluating models. To emulate human intelligence in dual-view detection, we propose the Auxiliary-view Enhanced Network (AENet), a novel detection framework that leverages both the main and auxiliary views of the same object. The main-view pipeline focuses on detecting common categories, while the auxiliary-view pipeline handles more challenging categories using ``expert models" learned from the main view. Extensive experiments on the LDXray dataset demonstrate that the dual-view mechanism significantly enhances detection performance, e.g., achieving improvements of up to 24.7% for the challenging category of umbrellas. Furthermore, our results show that AENet exhibits strong generalization across seven different detection models for X-ray Inspection</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Multi-Layered Radiation Shields Constructed from Polyethylene and Metal Hydrides Using HZETRN and OLTARIS for space applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge for extended human spaceflights in deep space is the dangerous exposure to space radiation. In previous studies aluminium has been used as a multilayer shielding material in GCR space radiation environment with high dose equivalent. To further reduce the dose equivalent, shielding effectiveness of various metal hydrides in GCR free space environment is investigated using HZETRN2015 (High charge (Z) &amp; Energy TRaNsport) and OLTARIS (On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation In Space) in this work. Metal hydride materials are chosen because of their capacity to store hydrogen. Among these materials, lithium hydride has demonstrated superior effectiveness as a radiation shield. Given this, the potential of a multilayer shield composed of polyethylene and lithium hydride is also being explored considering the tensile strength certain varieties of polyethylene like UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Poly-Ethylene) can provide. The results from HZETRN2015 and OLTARIS transport codes are compared and found in agreement.</description>

      <title>From Exploration to Revelation: Detecting Dark Patterns in Mobile Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile apps are essential in daily life, yet they often employ dark patterns, such as visual tricks to highlight certain options or linguistic tactics to nag users into making purchases, to manipulate user behavior. Current research mainly uses manual methods to detect dark patterns, a process that is time-consuming and struggles to keep pace with continually updating and emerging apps. While some studies targeted at automated detection, they are constrained to static patterns and still necessitate manual app exploration. To bridge these gaps, we present AppRay, an innovative system that seamlessly blends task-oriented app exploration with automated dark pattern detection, reducing manual efforts. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we harness the commonsense knowledge of large language models for targeted app exploration, supplemented by traditional random exploration to capture a broader range of UI states. Second, we developed a static and dynamic dark pattern detector powered by a contrastive learning-based multi-label classifier and a rule-based refiner to perform detection. We contributed two datasets, AppRay-Dark and AppRay-Light, with 2,185 unique deceptive patterns (including 149 dynamic instances) across 18 types from 876 UIs and 871 benign UIs. These datasets cover both static and dynamic dark patterns while preserving UI relationships. Experimental results confirm that AppRay can efficiently explore the app and identify a wide range of dark patterns with great performance.</description>

      <title>MONOPOLY: Learning to Price Public Facilities for Revaluing Private Properties with Large-Scale Urban Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The value assessment of private properties is an attractive but challenging task which is widely concerned by a majority of people around the world. A prolonged topic among us is ``\textit{how much is my house worth?}''. To answer this question, most experienced agencies would like to price a property given the factors of its attributes as well as the demographics and the public facilities around it. However, no one knows the exact prices of these factors, especially the values of public facilities which may help assess private properties. In this paper, we introduce our newly launched project ``Monopoly'' (named after a classic board game) in which we propose a distributed approach for revaluing private properties by learning to price public facilities (such as hospitals etc.) with the large-scale urban data we have accumulated via Baidu Maps. To be specific, our method organizes many points of interest (POIs) into an undirected weighted graph and formulates multiple factors including the virtual prices of surrounding public facilities as adaptive variables to parallelly estimate the housing prices we know. Then the prices of both public facilities and private properties can be iteratively updated according to the loss of prediction until convergence. We have conducted extensive experiments with the large-scale urban data of several metropolises in China. Results show that our approach outperforms several mainstream methods with significant margins. Further insights from more in-depth discussions demonstrate that the ``Monopoly'' is an innovative application in the interdisciplinary field of business intelligence and urban computing, and it will be beneficial to tens of millions of our users for investments and to the governments for urban planning as well as taxation.</description>

      <title>DMVC-Tracker: Distributed Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking Using Dynamic Buffered Voronoi and Inter-Visibility Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a distributed trajectory planning method for multi-agent aerial tracking. The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for determining optimal structures for atomic clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of adaptive genetic algorithms (AGA) for optimization problems has proven to be superior than many other methods due to its nature of producing more robust and high quality solutions. Considering the complexity involved in many-body simulations, a novel AGA is proposed for applications to such systems and is specifically used to determine the lowest energy structures of various sized atomic clusters. For demonstrative purposes, we apply our method to various sized Lennard-Jones clusters and show that our results are more accurate than those found in the literature employing different methods.</description>

      <title>There are More Fish in the Sea: Automated Vulnerability Repair via Binary Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As software vulnerabilities increase in both volume and complexity, vendors often struggle to repair them promptly. Automated vulnerability repair has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the burden of manual debugging and fixing activities. However, existing techniques exclusively focus on repairing the vulnerabilities at the source code level, which has various limitations. For example, they are not applicable to those (e.g., users or security analysts) who do not have access to the source code. Consequently, this restricts the practical application of these techniques, especially in cases where vendors are unable to provide timely patches. In this paper, we aim to address the above limitations by performing vulnerability repair at binary code level, and accordingly propose a template-based automated vulnerability repair approach for Java binaries. Built on top of the literature, we collect fix templates from both existing template-based automated program repair approaches and vulnerability-specific analyses, which are then implemented for the Java binaries. Our systematic application of these templates effectively mitigates vulnerabilities: experiments on the Vul4J dataset demonstrate that TemVUR successfully repairs 11 vulnerabilities, marking a notable 57.1% improvement over current repair techniques. Moreover, TemVUR securely fixes 66.7% more vulnerabilities compared to leading techniques (15 vs. 9), underscoring its effectiveness in mitigating the risks posed by these vulnerabilities. To assess the generalizability of TemVUR, we curate the ManyVuls4J dataset, which goes beyond Vul4J to encompass a wider diversity of vulnerabilities. With 30% more vulnerabilities than its predecessor (increasing from 79 to 103). The evaluation on ManyVuls4J reaffirms TemVUR's effectiveness and generalizability across a diverse set of real-world vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Parameter Prediction in Cardiovascular Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patient-specific modeling of cardiovascular flows with high-fidelity is challenging due to its dependence on accurately estimated velocity boundary profiles, which are essential for precise simulations and directly influence wall shear stress calculations - key in predicting cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis. This data, often derived from in vivo modalities like 4D flow MRI, suffers from low resolution and noise. To address this, we employ a stochastic data assimilation technique that integrates computational fluid dynamics with an advanced Ensemble-based Kalman filter, enhancing model accuracy while accounting for uncertainties. Our approach sequentially collects velocity data over time within the vascular model, enabling real-time refinement of unknown boundary estimations. The mathematical model uses the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation to simulate aortic blood flow. We consider unknown boundaries as constant, time-dependent, and space-time dependent in two- and three-dimensional models. In our 2-dimensional model, relative errors were as low as 0.996\% for constant boundaries and up to 2.63\% and 2.61\% for time-dependent and space-time dependent boundaries, respectively, over an observation span of two-time steps. For the 3-dimensional patient-specific model, the relative error was 7.37\% for space-time dependent boundaries. By refining the velocity boundary profile, our method improves wall shear stress predictions, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of models specific to individual cardiovascular patients. These advancements could contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>CIM-Based Parallel Fully FFNN Surface Code High-Level Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high sensitivity of qubits to environmental noise, which leads to decoherence and information loss, active quantum error correction(QEC) is essential. Surface codes represent one of the most promising fault-tolerant QEC schemes, but they require decoders that are accurate, fast, and scalable to large-scale quantum platforms. In all types of decoders, fully neural network-based high-level decoders offer decoding thresholds that surpass baseline decoder-Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and exhibit strong scalability, making them one of the ideal solutions for addressing surface code challenges. However, current fully neural network-based high-level decoders can only operate serially and do not meet the current latency requirements (below 440 ns). To address these challenges, we first propose a parallel fully feedforward neural network (FFNN) high-level surface code decoder, and comprehensively measure its decoding performance on a computing-in-memory (CIM) hardware simulation platform. With the currently available hardware specifications, our work achieves a decoding threshold of 14.22%, surpassing the MWPM baseline of 10.3%, and achieves high pseudo-thresholds of 10.4%, 11.3%, 12%, and 11.6% with decoding latencies of 197.03 ns, 234.87 ns, 243.73 ns, and 251.65 ns for distances of 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. The impact of hardware parameters and non-idealities on these results is discussed, and the hardware simulation results are extrapolated to a 4K quantum cryogenic environment.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Heat Generation Using Plasmonics: A Parabolic Transmission Problem Driven by the Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciting nanoparticles with incident frequencies close to their (subwavelength) resonances generate heat in the surrounding medium. Estimating the amount of heat generated is crucial for several applications. In this work, we consider the case of multiple such nanoparticles, aiming to estimate the generated effective heat. Specifically, we focus on plasmonic nanoparticles (e.g., metals) excited by an appropriate range of frequencies containing their plasmonic resonances. We derive the following results:
  1. When the nanoparticles are arbitrarily distributed within a bounded domain, the generated heat is described by a system of Volterra-type integral equations. The source terms, determined by the electric intensity of each nanoparticle, are themselves solutions of an algebraic system of Foldy-type equations. Thus, the (discrete) effective heat can be computed by solving these two coupled systems of equations. The dimensions of these systems are determined by the number of nanoparticles.
  2. When the number of nanoparticles is large, we derive the generated effective heat in a continuous form under certain natural scaling regimes. The corresponding effective heat equation is characterized, with the source terms related to the electric intensities obtained as solutions of the full Maxwell system with an effective permittivity that is also characterized.
  With this approach, we reduce the problem of heat generation using plasmonic nanoparticles to two sub-problems, namely a control problem for the parabolic model and an internal phaseless inverse problem for the Maxwell model.</description>

      <title>Multi-focal Picosecond laser vertical slicing of 6 inch 4H-SiC ingot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser direct writing inside materials has garnered significant attention for its applications in techniques like two-photon polymerization, stealth dicing and vertical slicing. 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) vertical slicing has wide potentials from research to industry due to low kerf loss and high slicing speed. In this paper, to improve the vertical slicing processing quality and lower the separation strength, we introduce a multi-focal vertical slicing method with spherical aberrations caused by refractive index eliminated. Additionally, by shaping the wavefront of picosecond laser, our experiments show the lower latitudinal ablation zone and higher crack propagation of multi-focal vertical slicing method on 4H-SiC, demonstrating that this method not only reduces filamentations to minimize ablation damage, but also significantly reduce the tensile strength during separation. We achieve a 6 inch 4H-SiC ingot vertical slicing and separation using 4-focal slicing. This method shows various potentials in laser processing.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Kernel Safety in the Spectre Era: Mitigations and Performance Evaluation (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of address space layout randomization has been formally demonstrated in a shared-memory model by Abadi et al., contingent on specific assumptions about victim programs. However, modern operating systems, implementing layout randomization in the kernel, diverge from these assumptions and operate on a separate memory model with communication through system calls. In this work, we relax Abadi et al.'s language assumptions while demonstrating that layout randomization offers a comparable safety guarantee in a system with memory separation. However, in practice, speculative execution and side-channels are recognized threats to layout randomization. We show that kernel safety cannot be restored for attackers capable of using side-channels and speculative execution, and introduce enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee speculative kernel safety for safe system calls in the Spectre era. We implement two suitable mechanisms and we use them to compile the Linux kernel in order to evaluate their performance overhead.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Closed Form of Expected Improvement for Gaussian Process Trained on Log-Transformed Objective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expected Improvement (EI) is arguably the most widely used acquisition function in Bayesian optimization. However, it is often challenging to enhance the performance with EI due to its sensitivity to numerical precision. Previously, Hutter et al. (2009) tackled this problem by using Gaussian process trained on the log-transformed objective function and it was reported that this trick improves the predictive accuracy of GP, leading to substantially better performance. Although Hutter et al. (2009) offered the closed form of their EI, its intermediate derivation has not been provided so far. In this paper, we give a friendly derivation of their proposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate monotonicity of limit wave speed of periodic traveling wave solutions for a perturbed generalized KdV equation via Abelian integral. We have answered an open problem outlined by Yan et al. (2014) and the conjecture proposed by Ouyang et al. (2022). Geometric singular perturbation theory allows for the reduction of a three-dimensional dynamical system to a near-Hamiltonian planar system. Furthermore, utilizing the monotonic behavior of the ratio of Abelian integrals, we develop a method to show the existence of at most one isolated periodic traveling wave which is much simpler proof than that in Yan et al.(2014). Finally, we present numerical simulations that perfectly match the theoretical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized cavity-mode emission from quantum dots in a semiconductor three-dimensional chiral photonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrated a circularly polarized cavity mode in a GaAs-based chiral photonic crystal (PhC) containing a planar defect. Low-temperature photoluminescence measurements of InAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in the planar defect revealed a polarization bandgap for left-handed circularly polarized light in the near-infrared spectrum. Within this bandgap, where the QDs preferably emitted right-handed circularly polarized light, we observed a distinct cavity-mode peak characterized by left-handed circular polarization. This observation indicates that the chiral PhC modifies the optical density of states for left-handed circular polarization to be suppressed in the polarization bandgap and be largely enhanced at the cavity mode. The results obtained may not only provide photonic devices such as compact circularly polarized light sources but also promote strong coupling between circularly polarized photons and excitons in solid states or molecules, paving the way for advancements in polaritonics, spintronics, and quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Small Embeddings for Elevated Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual Embeddings have yielded state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks. However, these embeddings are constrained by models requiring large amounts of data and huge computing power. This is an issue for low-resource languages like Nepali as the amount of data available over the internet is not always sufficient for the models. This work has taken an incomplete BERT model with six attention heads pretrained on Nepali language and finetuned it on previously unseen data. The obtained results from intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations have been compared to the results drawn from the original model baseline and a complete BERT model pretrained on Nepali language as the oracle. The results demonstrate that even though the oracle is better on average, finetuning the small embeddings drastically improves results compared to the original baseline.</description>

      <title>Derivative-free stochastic bilevel optimization for inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems are key issues in several scientific areas, including signal processing and medical imaging. Data-driven approaches for inverse problems aim for learning model and regularization parameters from observed data samples, and investigate their generalization properties when confronted with unseen data. This approach dictates a statistical approach to inverse problems, calling for stochastic optimization methods. In order to learn model and regularisation parameters simultaneously, we develop in this paper a stochastic bilevel optimization approach in which the lower level problem represents a variational reconstruction method formulated as a convex non-smooth optimization problem, depending on the observed sample. The upper level problem represents the learning task of the regularisation parameters. Combining the lower level and the upper level problem leads to a stochastic non-smooth and non-convex optimization problem, for which standard gradient-based methods are not straightforward to implement. Instead, we develop a unified and flexible methodology, building on a derivative-free approach, which allows us to solve the bilevel optimization problem only with samples of the objective function values. We perform a complete complexity analysis of this scheme. Numerical results on signal denoising and experimental design demonstrate the computational efficiency and the generalization properties of our method.</description>

      <title>Aligning Knowledge Concepts to Whole Slide Images for Precise Histopathology Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the large size and lack of fine-grained annotation, Whole Slide Images (WSIs) analysis is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</description>

      <title>On non self-normalizing subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a non negative integer, and define $D_n$ to be the family of all finite groups having precisely $n$ conjugacy classes of nontrivial subgroups that are not self-normalizing. We are interested in studying the behavior of $D_n$ and its interplay with solvability and nilpotency. We first show that if $G$ belongs to $D_n$ with $n \le 3$, then $G$ is solvable of derived length at most 2. We also show that $A_5$ is the unique nonsolvable group in $D_4$, and that $SL_2(3)$ is the unique solvable group in $D_4$ whose derived length is larger than 2. For a group $G$, we define $D(G)$ to be the number of conjugacy classes of nontrivial subgroups that are not self-normalizing. We determine the relationship between $D(H \times K)$ and $D(H)$ and $D(K)$. We show that if $G$ is nilpotent and lies in $D_n$, then $G$ has nilpotency class at most $n/2$ and its derived length is at most $\log_2 (n/2) + 1$. We consider $D_n$ for several classes of Frobenius groups, and we use this classification to classify the groups in $D_0$, $D_1$, $D_2$, and $D_3$. Finally, we show that if $G$ is solvable and lies in $D_n$ with $n \ge 3$, then $G$ has derived length at most the minimum of $n-1$ and $3 \log_2 (n+1) + 9$.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuron firing and beating of cilia. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, emsemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the time development of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Training and Evaluating Language Models with Template-based Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving, due in part to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for training sophisticated reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel approach that leverages LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which are then used to synthesize a vast array of high-quality problems and solutions. Leveraging TDG, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a dataset comprising over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems--each accompanied by code-based and natural language solutions--with the potential to generate an effectively unlimited number more. This dataset alleviates the scarcity of large-scale mathematical datasets and serves as a valuable resource for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs in mathematical reasoning. Our method not only enables the generation of virtually infinite data but also elevates data augmentation to a new level by using GPT-4 for meta-template generation, ensuring diverse and high-quality problem structures. The TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/TemplateGSM. The code is available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.</description>

      <title>Study on the Temporal Evolution of the Radial Differential Rotation of Solar Corona Using Radio Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The daily measurements of the disc-integrated solar radio flux, observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, and 8800 MHz during the time interval of 1989 January 1 to 2019 December 17, are used to investigate the temporal evolution of radial differential rotation of solar corona using the methods of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and wavelet analysis. Overall, the results reveal that over the 30-year period, the rotation rates for the observed solar radio flux within the frequency range of 245\textendash8800 MHz show an increase with frequency. This verifies the existence of the radial differential rotation of the solar corona over long timescales of nearly 3 solar cycles. Based on the radio emission mechanism, to some extent, the results can also serve as an indicator of how the rotation of the solar upper atmosphere varies with altitude within a specific range. From the temporal variation of rotation cycle lengths of radio flux, the coronal rotation at different altitudes from the low corona to approximately 1.3 $R_{\odot}$ exhibits complex temporal variations with the progression of the solar cycle. However, in this altitude range, over the past 30 years from 1989 to 2019, the coronal rotation consistently becomes gradually slower as the altitude increases. Finally, the EEMD method can extract rotation cycle signals from these highly randomized radio emissions, and so it can be used to investigate the rotation periods for the radio emissions at higher or lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Flame-wall interaction of thermodiffusively unstable hydrogen/air flames -- Part II: Parametric variations of equivalence ratio, temperature, and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuel-lean hydrogen combustion systems hold significant potential for low pollutant emissions, but are also susceptible to intrinsic combustion instabilities. While most research on these instabilities has focused on flames without wall confinement, practical combustors are typically enclosed by walls that strongly influence the combustion dynamics. In part I of this work, the flame-wall interaction of intrinsically unstable hydrogen/air flames has been studied for a single operating condition through detailed numerical simulations in a two-dimensional head-on quenching configuration. This study extends the previous investigation to a wide range of gas turbine and engine-relevant operating conditions, including variations in equivalence ratio (0.4 - 1.0), unburnt gas temperature (298 K - 700 K), and pressure (1.01325 bar - 20 bar). These parametric variations allow for a detailed analysis and establish a baseline for modeling the effects of varying instability intensities on the quenching process, as the relative influence of thermodiffusive and hydrodynamic instabilities depends on the operating conditions. While the quenching characteristics remain largely unaffected by hydrodynamic instabilities, the presence of thermodiffusive instabilities significantly increases the mean wall-heat flux and reduces the mean quenching distance. Furthermore, the impact of thermodiffusive instabilities on the quenching process intensifies as their intensity increases, driven by an increase in pressures and a decrease in equivalence ratio and unburnt gas temperature.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Discrete Representations and Self-Augmented Representations for Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have shown exceptional capabilities across various speech-processing tasks. Continuous SSL representations are effective but suffer from high computational and storage demands. On the other hand, discrete SSL representations, although with degraded performance, reduce transmission and storage costs, and improve input sequence efficiency through de-duplication and subword-modeling. To boost the performance of discrete representations for ASR, we introduce a novel fusion mechanism that integrates two discrete representations. The fusion mechanism preserves all the benefits of discrete representation while enhancing the model's performance by integrating complementary information. Additionally, we explore "self-augmented'' discrete representations, which apply transformations to a single continuous SSL representation, eliminating the fusion mechanism's dependency on multiple SSL models and further decreasing its inference costs. Experimental results on benchmarks, including LibriSpeech and ML-SUPERB, indicate up to 19% and 24% relative character error rate improvement compared with the non-fusion baseline, validating the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive fluctuation-response inequalities for Markov jump processes that link the fluctuations of general observables to the response to perturbations in the transition rates within a unified framework. These inequalities are derived using the Cram\'er-Rao bound, enabling broader applicability compared to existing fluctuation-response relations formulated for static responses of current-like observables. The fluctuation-response inequalities are valid for a wider class of observables and are applicable to finite observation times through dynamic responses. Furthermore, we extend these inequalities to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad quantum master equation and find the quantum fluctuation-response inequality, where dynamical activity plays a central role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can improve model performance by leveraging unlabeled images, which can be collected from public image sources with low costs. In recent years, synthetic images have become increasingly common in public image sources due to rapid advances in generative models. Therefore, it is becoming inevitable to include existing synthetic images in the unlabeled data for SSL. How this kind of contamination will affect SSL remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Real-Synthetic Hybrid SSL (RS-SSL), to investigate the impact of unlabeled data contaminated by synthetic images for SSL. First, we set up a new RS-SSL benchmark to evaluate current SSL methods and found they struggled to improve by unlabeled synthetic images, sometimes even negatively affected. To this end, we propose RSMatch, a novel SSL method specifically designed to handle the challenges of RS-SSL. RSMatch effectively identifies unlabeled synthetic data and further utilizes them for improvement. Extensive experimental results show that RSMatch can transfer synthetic unlabeled data from `obstacles' to `resources.' The effectiveness is further verified through ablation studies and visualization.</description>

      <title>Loss-driven miniaturized bound state in continuum biosensing system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurface has brought a revolution in label-free molecular sensing, attracting extensive attention. Currently, such sensing approaches are being designed to respond to peak wavelengths with a higher Q factor in the visible and near-infrared regions.Nevertheless, a higher Q factor that enhances light confinement will inevitably deteriorate the wavelength sensitivity and complicate the sensing system. We propose a Q-switched sensing mechanism, which enables the real part of the refractive index to effectively perturbate the damping loss of the oscillator, resulting in a boost of peak intensity.Consequently, a higher Q factor in Q-switched sensor can further enhance the peak sensitivity while remaining compatible with broadband light sources, simultaneously meeting the requirements of high performance and a compact system.This is achieved in a unique 3D bound-state-in-continuum (BIC) metasurface which can be mass-produced by wafer-scale aluminum-nanoimprinting technology and provides a peak intensity sensitivity up to 928 %/RIU.Therefore, a miniaturized BIC biosensing system is realized, with a limit of detection to 10E-5 refractive index units and 129 aM extracellular vesicles in clinical lung cancer diagnosis, both of which are magnitudes lower than those of current state-of-the-art biosensors. It further demonstrates significant potential for home cancer self-testing equipment for post-operative follow-up. This Q-switched sensing mechanism offers a new perspective for the commercialization of advanced and practical BIC optical biosensing systems in real-setting scenarios.</description>

      <title>When Large Vision-Language Models Meet Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that incorporate visual models and Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various cross-modal understanding and reasoning tasks. In recent years, person re-identification (ReID) has also started to explore cross-modal semantics to improve the accuracy of identity recognition. However, effectively utilizing LVLMs for ReID remains an open challenge. While LVLMs operate under a generative paradigm by predicting the next output word, ReID requires the extraction of discriminative identity features to match pedestrians across cameras. In this paper, we propose LVLM-ReID, a novel framework that harnesses the strengths of LVLMs to promote ReID. Specifically, we employ instructions to guide the LVLM in generating one pedestrian semantic token that encapsulates key appearance semantics from the person image. This token is further refined through our Semantic-Guided Interaction (SGI) module, establishing a reciprocal interaction between the semantic token and visual tokens. Ultimately, the reinforced semantic token serves as the pedestrian identity representation. Our framework integrates the semantic understanding and generation capabilities of LVLMs into end-to-end ReID training, allowing LVLMs to capture rich semantic cues from pedestrian images during both training and inference. Our method achieves competitive results on multiple benchmarks without additional image-text annotations, demonstrating the potential of LVLM-generated semantics to advance person ReID and offering a promising direction for future research.</description>

Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read-out via luminescence. Here we demonstrate a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet-derived luminescence, formed by appending a non-luminescent TEMPO radical to Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet-triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical-triplet coupled states. We establish a set of design rules by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. We observe generation of quartet states and measure the strength of radical-triplet exchange (0.7 GHz). In DMAC-TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high-spin state. The large library of TADF chromophores promises a greater pallet of achievable emission colours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a generalization of McKay correspondence in positive characteristic regarding Euler characteristic of crepant resolutions given by finite subgroups of the special linear group. As the main result, we prove that the generalization holds for groups with a specific semidirect product structure. Apart from such groups, two certain examples for groups with more difficult structure are also given.</description>

      <title>A 65-nm Reliable 6T CMOS SRAM Cell with Minimum Size Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As minimum area SRAM bit-cells are obtained when using cell ratio and pull-up ratio of 1, we analyze the possibility of decreasing the cell ratio from the conventional values comprised between 1.5-2.5 to 1. The impact of this option on area, power, performance and stability is analyzed showing that the most affected parameter is read stability, although this impact can be overcome using some of the read assist circuits proposed in the literature. The main benefits are layout regularity enhancement, with its consequent higher tolerance to variability, cell area reduction by 25% (with respect to a cell having a cell ratio of 2), leakage current improvement by a 35%, as well as energy dissipation reduction and a soft error rate per bit improvement of around 30%.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Spatial Transformer with Active Transfer Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) is a challenging task due to the high spectral dimensionality and limited labeled data typically available for training. In this study, we propose a novel multi-stage active transfer learning (ATL) framework that integrates a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) with an active learning process for efficient HSI classification. Our approach leverages a pre-trained (initially trained) SST model, fine-tuned iteratively on newly acquired labeled samples using an uncertainty-diversity (Spatial-Spectral Neighborhood Diversity) querying mechanism. This mechanism identifies the most informative and diverse samples, thereby optimizing the transfer learning process to reduce both labeling costs and model uncertainty. We further introduce a dynamic freezing strategy, selectively freezing layers of the SST model to minimize computational overhead while maintaining adaptability to spectral variations in new data. One of the key innovations in our work is the self-calibration of spectral and spatial attention weights, achieved through uncertainty-guided active learning. This not only enhances the model's robustness in handling dynamic and disjoint spectral profiles but also improves generalization across multiple HSI datasets. Additionally, we present a diversity-promoting sampling strategy that ensures the selected samples span distinct spectral regions, preventing overfitting to particular spectral classes. Experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that the SST-ATL framework significantly outperforms existing CNN and SST-based methods, offering superior accuracy, efficiency, and computational performance.

      <description>arXiv:2411.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation of the quantum Oppenheimer- Snyde black hole with the tunneling scheme by Parikh and Wilczek. We calculate the emission rate of massless scalar particles. Compared to the traditional results within the framework of General Relativity, our findings include quantum correction terms arising from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the approach in [1, 2], we establish the entropy of the black hole. This entropy includes a logarithmic correction, which arises from quantum gravity effects. Our result is consistent with the well-known result in the context of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Drawing of Weakly Viscoelastic Fluid Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the drawing of an axisymmetric viscoelastic tube subject to inertial and surface tension effects. We adopt the Giesekus constitutive model and derive asymptotic long-wave equations for weakly viscoelastic effects. Intuitively, one might imagine that the elastic stresses should act to prevent hole closure during the drawing process. Surprisingly, our results show that the hole closure at the outlet is enhanced by elastic effects for most parameter values. However, the opposite is true if the tube has a very large hole size at the inlet of the device or if the axial stretching is very weak. We explain the physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon by examining how the second normal stress difference induced by elastic effects modifies the hole evolution process. We also determine how viscoelasticity affects the stability of the drawing process and show that elastic effects are always destabilizing for negligible inertia. This is in direct contrast to the case of a thread without a hole for which elastic effects are always stabilizing. On the other hand, our results show that if the inertia is non-zero, elastic effects can be either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the parameters.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based Recovery of Thermal Fields from Displacement or Strain Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-element method dependant adjoint-based procedure to determine the temperature field of structures based on measured displacements or strains and a set of standard loads is developed and tested. Given a series of force and deformation measurements, the temperature field is obtained by minimizing the adequately weighted differences between the measured and computed values. Three numerical examples - a Plate With a Hole, a Bridge, and a Hoover Dam example - each with multiple sensors distributed in different configurations, demonstrate the procedure's capabilities. A target temperature distribution is prescribed in all cases, and the displacement sensor data is recorded. The optimization algorithm (here, steepest descent with Barzilai-Borwein step) uses this data to optimize the temperatures such that the same deformation is obtained at the sensor locations. Vertex Morphing is used as a filter to mitigate the ill-conditioning. Results show that the proposed approach can accurately reconstruct the target thermal distribution, especially when more sensors are used. Additionally, it is observed that the sensors do not need to be positioned in the region of interest; the method remains effective as long as the sensors can detect changes related to that area. A comparison with standard spatial interpolation techniques, namely, k-nearest neighbors and ordinary and universal kriging, is performed using temperature sensors in the same configurations. The proposed approach performs remarkably better than the interpolation techniques with a reduction in the root-mean-squared error of up to 38.4%, 94%, and 40%, for the Plate With a Hole, the Bridge, and the Dam examples, respectively.</description>

      <title>Half-metallic to ferromagnetic phase transition in CrSH monolayer using DFT+U and BO-MD calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of CrSH monolayers in the 1T and 2H phases using density functional theory (DFT)+U calculations with a converged Hubbard U value of 5.54 eV and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BO-MD) simulations. The ferromagnetic (FM) 1T-CrSH phase is found to be dynamically and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting semiconducting behavior with a band gap of 1.1 eV and a magnetic moment of 3.0 $\mu$B per Cr atom. On the other hand, the 2H-CrSH phase is a half-metallic (HM) phase. We found that it is a metastable phase and undergoes a rapid phase transition to the 1T phase under finite temperature at 300 K. Phonon calculations, performed using the finite displacement method and corrected for rotational invariance corrections with Huang and Born-Huang sum rules, resolve spurious imaginary frequencies in the flexural ZA phonon mode near the $\Gamma$-point, ensuring physical accuracy. These findings establish CrSH monolayers as promising candidates for spintronic and valleytronic applications, with tunable electronic properties enabled by phase engineering.</description>

      <title>The Bigger the Better? Accurate Molecular Potential Energy Surfaces from Minimalist Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of molecules, proteins, and materials on wide time and length scales. Their reliability and predictiveness, however, depend directly on the accuracy of the underlying potential energy surface (PES). Guided by the principle of parsimony this work introduces KerNN, a combined kernel/neural network-based approach to represent molecular PESs. Compared to state-of-the-art neural network PESs the number of learnable parameters of KerNN is significantly reduced. This speeds up training and evaluation times by several orders of magnitude while retaining high prediction accuracy. Importantly, using kernels as the features also improves the extrapolation capabilities of KerNN far beyond the coverage provided by the training data which solves a general problem of NN-based PESs. KerNN applied to spectroscopy and reaction dynamics shows excellent performance on test set statistics and observables including vibrational bands computed from classical and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-based Framework towards Assessment of Decision-Makers' Biases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased human decisions have consequential impacts across various domains, yielding unfair treatment of individuals and resulting in suboptimal outcomes for organizations and society. In recognition of this fact, organizations regularly design and deploy interventions aimed at mitigating these biases. However, measuring human decision biases remains an important but elusive task. Organizations are frequently concerned with mistaken decisions disproportionately affecting one group. In practice, however, this is typically not possible to assess due to the scarcity of a gold standard: a label that indicates what the correct decision would have been. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to assess bias in human-generated decisions when gold standard labels are scarce. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of our method over existing alternatives. This proposed methodology establishes a foundation for transparency in human decision-making, carrying substantial implications for managerial duties, and offering potential for alleviating algorithmic biases when human decisions are used as labels to train algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper leverages stochastic geometry to model, analyze, and optimize multi-band unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks operating across low-frequency and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. We introduce a novel approach to modeling mmWave antenna gain in such networks, which allows us to better capture and account for interference in our analysis and optimization. We then propose a simple yet effective user-UAV association policy, which strategically biases users towards mmWave UAVs to take advantage of lower interference and wider bandwidths compared to low-frequency UAVs. Under this scheme, we analytically derive the corresponding association probability, coverage probability, and spectral efficiency. We conclude by assessing our proposed association policy through simulation and analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness based on coverage probability and per-user data rates, as well as the alignment between analytical and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Influence of Critical Current Distribution on Operation, Quench Detection and Protection of HTS Pancake Coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductor (HTS) coated conductors (CC) are often wound into pancake coils with electrical insulation in-between the turns. The copper terminals are used for current injection and conduction cooling. An inherent variation of the critical current along the CC length results from its manufacturing process. This variation causes non-uniform heat generation, particularly when the coil is operated at a high fraction of the nominal critical current or when large critical current defects are present. The temperature distribution resulting from the balance between cooling and heating, in combination with the magnetic field and critical current distributions, determines whether a thermal runaway occurs. Accurately predicting the level of critical current defects that can be tolerated during conduction-cooled operation is difficult and requires a 3D coupled electromagnetic and thermal simulation. This paper presents the results of simulations that are performed with the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) tool developed at CERN as part of the STEAM framework. The 3D coupled magnetodynamic-thermal simulations are based on the H-phi formulation and use thin shell approximations, a CC homogenization and conduction-cooling. The critical current (Ic) is varied along the CC length. The effect of a single defect specified as a reduction of Ic along the CC length is investigated in terms of the coil's ability to reach and maintain the operating conditions. The Ic and length of the defect that results in a thermal runaway are analyzed in terms of defect location. In addition, a classical 1D scenario with a quench heater is studied. Both the local defect and the heater cases are compared in terms of the voltage signal available for quench detection. These cases result in very different requirements for quench detection, and their implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>A new method for studying the blazar variability on the shortest time scales and its application to S5 1803+784</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for investigating the evolution of the properties of the blazar brightness variability on timescales from a few hours to a few days. Its essence lies in detecting sequentially located time intervals along the entire light curve, within which it is possible to determine the characteristic time of variability using the structure function. We applied this method to a uniform data series lasting several days provided by the TESS mission for blazar S5 1803+784. Then, we analyzed the found time parameters of variability coupled with the data of B-, V-, R-, and I-photometric observations. A correlation was found between the amplitude and the characteristic time of variability. The relation of these values with the spectral index of radiation has not been revealed. We conclude that the variability on a short time scale is formed due to the different Doppler factors for having different volume parts of the optical emitting region. At the same time, the radiation spectrum deflects slightly from the power-law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities with a few demonstrations. However, one critical challenge is how to select demonstrations to elicit the full potential of LLMs. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Demonstration Selection (CDS), a novel demonstration selection method for ICL. Instead of merely using similarity, CDS additionally partitions samples by their complexity measurements. Following curriculum learning, CDS then selects demonstrations from easy to difficult. Thus the selected demonstrations cover a wide range of difficulty levels, enabling LLMs to learn from varied complexities within the training set. Experiments demonstrate that our CDS consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving notable improvements across nine LLMs on three benchmarks. Moreover, CDS proves especially effective in enhancing LLM performance in solving challenging problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel collaborative neurodynamic model for computing nonnegative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). The model relies on a system of recurrent neural networks to solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem associated with nonnegative CPD. Additionally, a discrete-time version of the continuous neural network is developed. To enhance the chances of reaching a potential global minimum, the recurrent neural networks are allowed to communicate and exchange information through particle swarm optimization (PSO). Convergence and stability analyses of both the continuous and discrete neurodynamic models are thoroughly examined. Experimental evaluations are conducted on random and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approximation of High-Dimensional Functions with Small Efficient Dimension with Applications in Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the approximation of high-dimensional functions, which are effectively low-dimensional, does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This is shown first in a general reproducing kernel Hilbert space set-up and then specifically for Sobolev and mixed-regularity Sobolev spaces. Finally, efficient estimates are derived for deciding whether a high-dimensional function is effectively low-dimensional by studying error bounds in weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The results are applied to parametric partial differential equations, a typical problem from uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Edge-Assisted Accelerated Cooperative Sensing for CAVs: Task Placement and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel road side unit (RSU)-assisted cooperative sensing scheme for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), with the objective to reduce completion time of sensing tasks. Specifically, LiDAR sensing data of both RSU and CAVs are selectively fused to improve sensing accuracy, and computing resources therein are cooperatively utilized to process tasks in real time. To this end, for each task, we decide whether to compute it at the CAV or at the RSU and allocate resources accordingly. We first formulate a joint task placement and resource allocation problem for minimizing the total task completion time while satisfying sensing accuracy constraint. We then decouple the problem into two subproblems and propose a two-layer algorithm to solve them. The outer layer first makes task placement decision based on the Gibbs sampling theory, while the inner layer makes spectrum and computing resource allocation decisions via greedy-based and convex optimization subroutines, respectively. Simulation results based on the autonomous driving simulator CARLA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing total task completion time, comparing to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions of the kaon and pion within the nonlocal chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we explore the properties of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for the kaon and pion within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\chi$QM). Valence quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are analyzed with respect to their momentum fraction $x$ and skewness $\xi$ dependencies in the DGLAP and ERBL regions. We observe that the asymmetry of the current quark masses in kaon results in a significant distortion of the quark GPDs in kaon near $\xi=1$, compared to the case of the pion. The quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are evolved to $\mu^2 = 4$ GeV$^2$ and 100 GeV$^2$ by the QCD evolution equation at one-loop order using the \texttt{APFEL++} package. We find that the produced sea quarks and gluons are largely suppressed as $\xi$ becomes nonzero, predominantly confined within the ERBL region. We subsequently examine the polynomiality of the GPDs and numerically obtain the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the kaon and pion. For the kaon, gravitational form factor ratios $A_{\bar s/K^+}(0)/A_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.26$ and $D_{\bar s/K^+}(0)/D_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.10$ are reported and compared with results from other effective models.</description>

      <title>Distributions of mesh patterns of short lengths on king permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Br\"{a}nd\'{e}n and Claesson introduced the concept of mesh patterns in 2011, and since then, these patterns have attracted significant attention in the literature. Subsequently, in 2015, Hilmarsson \emph{et al.} initiated the first systematic study of avoidance of mesh patterns, while Kitaev and Zhang conducted the first systematic study of the distribution of mesh patterns in 2019. A permutation $\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_n$ in the symmetric group $S_n$ is called a king permutation if $\left| \sigma_{i+1}-\sigma_i \right| &gt; 1$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$. Riordan derived a recurrence relation for the number of such permutations in 1965. The generating function for king permutations was obtained by Flajolet and Sedgewick in 2009. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of the distribution of mesh patterns on king permutations by finding distributions for 22 mesh patterns of short length.</description>

      <title>Optical characterisation of ilmenite by reflectance spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-directional reflection spectroscopy based on multiple scattering of particulate surfaces is employed in identifying the optical properties of titanium-iron oxide mineral from laboratory reflection measurements.However, the approach suffers from issues including: i) both n and k are to be extracted from a single spectroscopy spectrum, ii) imposing constraints of the K-K correlation relating spectral n and k is weakened by its fundamental insensitivity, and iii) incapability in addressing intrinsic strong absorption features of absorbing materials. We resolve these issues by employing additional optical information of directional-hemispherical reflection and emission/absorption for a slab and a stratified multi-layer medium of the material, respectively. The accompanied analyses consist of radiation transfer in a slab medium investigated using the two-flux approximation method and electromagnetic radiation propagation in a stratified multi-layer medium investigated using the electric filed transfer matrix. We further find that an understanding of the internal scattering coefficient of grains in the multiple scattering model paves the way in successfully predicting absorption features of materials. A wavelength-dependent internal scattering coefficient of the material is then found to be 50 1/micrometer and 1/10000000 1/micrometer in regions of strong absorption and high transmission (between 7 and 13 micrometer), respectively. The value of the refractive index n varies weakly on the wavelength. A pronounced change in the determined absorptive index k with the wavelength is observed. Low values of the absorptive index k on the magnitude of 0.01 are obtained in the transmission window spectral range. In the strong absorption spectral range starting from 13 micrometer, values of the absorptive index k are higher than 0.1.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-device and Training-free Robotic Grasping in 3D Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic grasping in the open world is a critical component of manufacturing and automation processes. While numerous existing approaches depend on 2D segmentation output to facilitate the grasping procedure, accurately determining depth from 2D imagery remains a challenge, often leading to limited performance in complex stacking scenarios. In contrast, techniques utilizing 3D point cloud data inherently capture depth information, thus enabling adeptly navigating and manipulating a diverse range of complex stacking scenes. However, such efforts are considerably hindered by the variance in data capture devices and the unstructured nature of the data, which limits their generalizability. Consequently, much research is narrowly concentrated on managing designated objects within specific settings, which confines their real-world applicability. This paper presents a novel pipeline capable of executing object grasping tasks in open-world scenarios even on previously unseen objects without the necessity for training. Additionally, our pipeline supports the flexible use of different 3D point cloud segmentation models across a variety of scenes. Leveraging the segmentation results, we propose to engage a training-free binary clustering algorithm that not only improves segmentation precision but also possesses the capability to cluster and localize unseen objects for executing grasping operations. In our experiments, we investigate a range of open-world scenarios, and the outcomes underscore the remarkable robustness and generalizability of our pipeline, consistent across various environments, robots, cameras, and objects. The code will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Roles of $f_{0}(500)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ in the $D_{(s)}^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent measurements of the $D_{s}^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $D^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays by the LHCb Collaboration, we study these two decay processes by considering the final state interaction formalism. Taking into account the external and internal $W$-emission dominant mechanisms at the quark level, our model can naturally explain why the $D_{s}^{+}$ decay only has a contribution from the $f_{0}(980)$ resonance, while the $D^{+}$ decay has contributions from both the $f_{0}(500)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ states. The magnitudes and phases of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ for $S$-wave amplitudes in our model are in agreement with the experimental measurements. These results support the interpretations of $f_{0}(500)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ as the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar{K}$ resonances, respectively, where they are dynamically generated from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar meson interactions within the chiral unitary approach.</description>

      <title>ModeDreamer: Mode Guiding Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation using Reference Image Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based methods have driven significant progress in text-to-3D generation. However, 3D models produced by SDS-based methods tend to exhibit over-smoothing and low-quality outputs. These issues arise from the mode-seeking behavior of current methods, where the scores used to update the model oscillate between multiple modes, resulting in unstable optimization and diminished output quality. To address this problem, we introduce a novel image prompt score distillation loss named ISD, which employs a reference image to direct text-to-3D optimization toward a specific mode. Our ISD loss can be implemented by using IP-Adapter, a lightweight adapter for integrating image prompt capability to a text-to-image diffusion model, as a mode-selection module. A variant of this adapter, when not being prompted by a reference image, can serve as an efficient control variate to reduce variance in score estimates, thereby enhancing both output quality and optimization stability. Our experiments demonstrate that the ISD loss consistently achieves visually coherent, high-quality outputs and improves optimization speed compared to prior text-to-3D methods, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the T3Bench benchmark suite.</description>

      <title>On certain correlations into the Divisor Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed irrational $\theta&gt;0$ with a prescribed irrationality measure function, we study the correlation $\int\limits_{1}^{X}\Delta\left(x\right)\Delta\left(\theta x\right)dx$, where $\Delta$ is the Dirichlet's Delta Function from the Divisor Problem. It is known that when $\theta$ have finite irrationality measure there's a decorrelation given in terms of its measure and a strong decorrelation is obtained at every positive irrational number, except, maybe, at the Liouville numbers. We prove that for the irrationals with a prescribed irrationality measure function $\psi$, a decorrelation can be obtained in terms of $\psi^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Coin Change Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coin Change problem, also known as the Change-Making problem, is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem, which involves minimizing the number of coins needed to make a specific change amount using a given set of coin denominations. A natural and intuitive approach to this problem is the greedy algorithm. While the greedy algorithm is not universally optimal for all sets of coin denominations, it yields optimal solutions under most real-world coin systems currently in use, making it an efficient heuristic with broad practical applicability. Researchers have been studying ways to determine whether a given coin system guarantees optimal solutions under the greedy approach, but surprisingly little attention has been given to understanding the general computational behavior of the greedy algorithm applied to the coin change problem.
  To address this gap, we introduce the Greedy Coin Change problem and formalize its decision version: given a target amount $W$ and a set of denominations $C$, determine whether a specific coin is included in the greedy solution. We prove that this problem is $\mathbf P$-complete under log-space reductions, which implies it is unlikely to be efficiently parallelizable or solvable in limited space.</description>

      <title>SALMONN-omni: A Codec-free LLM for Full-duplex Speech Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-duplex multimodal large language models (LLMs) provide a unified framework for addressing diverse speech understanding and generation tasks, enabling more natural and seamless human-machine conversations. Unlike traditional modularised conversational AI systems, which separate speech recognition, understanding, and text-to-speech generation into distinct components, multimodal LLMs operate as single end-to-end models. This streamlined design eliminates error propagation across components and fully leverages the rich non-verbal information embedded in input speech signals. We introduce SALMONN-omni, a codec-free, full-duplex speech understanding and generation model capable of simultaneously listening to its own generated speech and background sounds while speaking. To support this capability, we propose a novel duplex spoken dialogue framework incorporating a ``thinking'' mechanism that facilitates asynchronous text and speech generation relying on embeddings instead of codecs (quantized speech and audio tokens). Experimental results demonstrate SALMONN-omni's versatility across a broad range of streaming speech tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement, and spoken question answering. Additionally, SALMONN-omni excels at managing turn-taking, barge-in, and echo cancellation scenarios, establishing its potential as a robust prototype for full-duplex conversational AI systems. To the best of our knowledge, SALMONN-omni is the first codec-free model of its kind. A full technical report along with model checkpoints will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Crosstalk Silicon Electro-Optic Switch with Cascaded Phase Shifters for Loss Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In silicon electro-optic (EO) Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) switches, crosstalk is typically limited by beam imbalance between the MZI arms, primarily caused by the free carrier absorption loss during routing, thus hindering switch scalability. To address this issue, we propose a low-crosstalk push-pull EO MZI switch by cascading a lightly doped, long phase shifter (PSLL) and a heavily doped, short phase shifter (PSHS) to construct phase-shift arms. In both BAR and CROSS states, PSLL in one arm and PSHS in the other arm are simultaneously forward-biased, with PSLL provides a pi/2 greater phase shift for switching, while PSHS balances loss of PSLL, effectively minimizing crosstalk. Simulations indicate that the proposed switch achieves a crosstalk below -51 dB at a 1310 nm wavelength. The fabricated 2 x 2 silicon EO MZI switch exhibited crosstalk between -33 and -44.2 dB at 1316 nm, and maintained crosstalk below -30 dB across an impressive 61 nm optical bandwidth, with response times under 119 ns. Featuring single-pair electrode control, consistent two-state performance, and a compact size, this approach could enable high-radix switch fabrics in data centers and artificial intelligence compute clusters.</description>

      <title>Inverse Scattering Transform for the Massive Thirring Model: Delving into Higher-Order Pole Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse scattering problem for the massive Thirring model, focusing particularly on cases where the transmission coefficient exhibits $N$ pairs of higher-order poles. Our methodology involves transforming initial data into scattering data via the direct scattering problem. Utilizing two parameter transformations, we examine the asymptotic properties of the Jost functions at both vanishing and infinite parameters, yielding two equivalent spectral problems. We subsequently devise a mapping that translates the obtained scattering data into a $2 \times 2$ matrix Riemann--Hilbert problem, incorporating several residue conditions at $N$ pairs of multiple poles. Additionally, we construct an equivalent pole-free Riemann--Hilbert problem and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of its solution. In the reflectionless case, the $N$-multipole solutions can be reconstructed by resolving two linear algebraic systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Water Quality using Quantum Machine Learning: The Case of the Umgeni Catchment (U20A) Study Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a real-world application of QML techniques to study water quality in the U20A region in Durban, South Africa. Specifically, we applied the quantum support vector classifier (QSVC) and quantum neural network (QNN), and we showed that the QSVC is easier to implement and yields a higher accuracy. The QSVC models were applied for three kernels: Linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF), and it was shown that the polynomial and RBF kernels had exactly the same performance. The QNN model was applied using different optimizers, learning rates, noise on the circuit components, and weight initializations were considered, but the QNN persistently ran into the dead neuron problem. Thus, the QNN was compared only by accraucy and loss, and it was shown that with the Adam optimizer, the model has the best performance, however, still less than the QSVC.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual Reasoning with Autonomous Imagination in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been recent efforts to extend the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by finding visual clues in the input scene, advancing the visual reasoning ability of MLLMs. However, current approaches are specially designed for the tasks where clue finding plays a major role in the whole reasoning process, leading to the difficulty in handling complex visual scenes where clue finding does not actually simplify the whole reasoning task. To deal with this challenge, we propose a new visual reasoning paradigm enabling MLLMs to autonomously modify the input scene to new ones based on its reasoning status, such that CoT is reformulated as conducting simple closed-loop decision-making and reasoning steps under a sequence of imagined visual scenes, leading to natural and general CoT construction. To implement this paradigm, we introduce a novel plug-and-play imagination space, where MLLMs conduct visual modifications through operations like focus, ignore, and transform based on their native reasoning ability without specific training. We validate our approach through a benchmark spanning dense counting, simple jigsaw puzzle solving, and object placement, challenging the reasoning ability beyond clue finding. The results verify that while existing techniques fall short, our approach enables MLLMs to effectively reason step by step through autonomous imagination.

      <title>Harnessing Large Language Models for Seed Generation in Greybox Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greybox fuzzing has emerged as a preferred technique for discovering software bugs, striking a balance between efficiency and depth of exploration. While research has focused on improving fuzzing techniques, the importance of high-quality initial seeds remains critical yet often overlooked. Existing methods for seed generation are limited, especially for programs with non-standard or custom input formats. Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized numerous domains, showcasing unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating complex patterns across various fields of knowledge. This paper introduces SeedMind, a novel system that leverages LLMs to boost greybox fuzzing through intelligent seed generation. Unlike previous approaches, SeedMind employs LLMs to create test case generators rather than directly producing test cases. Our approach implements an iterative, feedback-driven process that guides the LLM to progressively refine test case generation, aiming for increased code coverage depth and breadth. In developing SeedMind, we addressed key challenges including input format limitations, context window constraints, and ensuring consistent, progress-aware behavior. Intensive evaluations with real-world applications show that SeedMind effectively harnesses LLMs to generate high-quality test cases and facilitate fuzzing in bug finding, presenting utility comparable to human-created seeds and significantly outperforming the existing LLM-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Household Resource Allocation Dynamics and Policies: Integrating Future Earnings of Children, Fertility, Pension, Health, and Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a model that examines how families make decisions about having children, managing resources, and planning for their financial security in light of social and economic factors. It explores the balance between the number of children and the quality of life parents wish to provide, including education and future income prospects. By considering parents' expectations about their children's future earnings, the model gives new insights into how families allocate their resources. It also looks at how decisions about savings and pensions are connected to daily spending and family planning, showing the complex links between these factors. The findings offer valuable guidance for policies that address these interrelated challenges and better support families in managing their resources.</description>

      <title>COREval: A Comprehensive and Objective Benchmark for Evaluating the Remote Sensing Capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), both general-domain models and those specifically tailored for remote sensing Earth observation, have demonstrated exceptional perception and reasoning abilities within this specific field. However, the current absence of a comprehensive benchmark for holistically evaluating the remote sensing capabilities of these VLMs represents a significant gap. To bridge this gap, we propose COREval, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively and objectively evaluate the hierarchical remote sensing capabilities of VLMs. Concentrating on 2 primary capability dimensions essential to remote sensing: perception and reasoning, we further categorize 6 secondary dimensions and 22 leaf tasks to ensure a well-rounded assessment coverage for this specific field. COREval guarantees the quality of the total of 6,263 problems through a rigorous process of data collection from 50 globally distributed cities, question construction and quality control, and the format of multiple-choice questions with definitive answers allows for an objective and straightforward evaluation of VLM performance. We conducted a holistic evaluation of 13 prominent open-source VLMs from both the general and remote sensing domains, highlighting current shortcomings in their remote sensing capabilities and providing directions for improvements in their application within this specialized context. We hope that COREval will serve as a valuable resource and offer deeper insights into the challenges and potential of VLMs in the field of remote sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics is proved to admit no hidden-variable in 1960s, which means the quantum systems are contextual. Revealing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is a significant task. We develop the approach of partial Boolean algebra to characterize the contextuality theory with local consistency and exclusivity, and then prove that the finite quantum systems are determined by atoms using two graph structure theorems. We also generalize our work to infinite cases. Our conclusions indicate that the quantum mechanics is a graph-structured combination of multiple hidden-variable theories, and provide a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality</description>

      <title>Online Knowledge Integration for 3D Semantic Mapping: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic mapping is a key component of robots operating in and interacting with objects in structured environments. Traditionally, geometric and knowledge representations within a semantic map have only been loosely integrated. However, recent advances in deep learning now allow full integration of prior knowledge, represented as knowledge graphs or language concepts, into sensor data processing and semantic mapping pipelines. Semantic scene graphs and language models enable modern semantic mapping approaches to incorporate graph-based prior knowledge or to leverage the rich information in human language both during and after the mapping process. This has sparked substantial advances in semantic mapping, leading to previously impossible novel applications. This survey reviews these recent developments comprehensively, with a focus on online integration of knowledge into semantic mapping. We specifically focus on methods using semantic scene graphs for integrating symbolic prior knowledge and language models for respective capture of implicit common-sense knowledge and natural language concepts</description>

      <title>A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>Timing analysis of rotating radio transients discovered with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit pulses of radiation at regular intervals, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The precise recording and modelling of the arrival times of pulsar emission is known as timing analysis. Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a subclass of pulsars that emit pulses very sporadically. Because of the sparse pulse times of arrival (ToAs) typically available for these sources, they are much more difficult to time than regular pulsars, to the extent that few RRATs currently have coherent timing solutions. In this work, we present the results of timing analyses for four RRATs discovered by the MeerTRAP transient survey using MeerKAT. We incorporated additional pulse ToAs from each source that have been detected since their original analysis. We confirmed the known timing solution for PSR J1843$-$0757, with a period of $P=2.03$ seconds, and a period derivative of $\dot{P}=4,13\times10^{-15}$. However, our analysis did not comport with the solution of MTP0005, which we conclude may have been mistakenly identified with the known PSR J1840$-$0815 in the original analysis. Finally, the spin period for MTP0007 was determined to be $1.023(1)$ seconds using a brute-force period fitting approach.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Approach to Smooth A* Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path planning for wheeled mobile robots is a critical component in the field of automation and intelligent transportation systems. Car-like vehicles, which have non-holonomic constraints on their movement capability impose additional requirements on the planned paths. Traditional path planning algorithms, such as A* , are widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness in finding optimal paths in complex environments. However, these algorithms often do not consider vehicle dynamics, resulting in paths that are infeasible or impractical for actual driving. Specifically, a path that minimizes the number of grid cells may still be too curvy or sharp for a car-like vehicle to navigate smoothly. This paper addresses the need for a path planning solution that not only finds a feasible path but also ensures that the path is smooth and drivable. By adapting the A* algorithm for a curvature constraint and incorporating a cost function that considers the smoothness of possible paths, we aim to bridge the gap between grid based path planning and smooth paths that are drivable by car-like vehicles. The proposed method leverages motion primitives, pre-computed using a ribbon based path planner that produces smooth paths of minimum curvature. The motion primitives guide the A* algorithm in finding paths of minimal length and curvature. With the proposed modification on the A* algorithm, the planned paths can be constraint to have a minimum turning radius much larger than the grid size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in different unstructured environments. In a two-stage planning approach, first the modified A* algorithm finds a grid-based path and the ribbon based path planner creates a smooth path within the area of grid cells. The resulting paths are smooth with small curvatures independent of the orientation of the grid axes and even in presence of sharp obstacles.</description>

      <title>Howzat? Appealing to Expert Judgement for Evaluating Human and AI Next-Step Hints for Novice Programmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Students learning to program often reach states where they are stuck and can make no forward progress. An automatically generated next-step hint can help them make forward progress and support their learning. It is important to know what makes a good hint or a bad hint, and how to generate good hints automatically in novice programming tools, for example using Large Language Models (LLMs).
  Method and participants: We recruited 44 Java educators from around the world to participate in an online study. We used a set of real student code states as hint-generation scenarios. Participants used a technique known as comparative judgement to rank a set of candidate next-step Java hints, which were generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and by five human experienced educators. Participants ranked the hints without being told how they were generated.
  Findings: We found that LLMs had considerable variation in generating high quality next-step hints for programming novices, with GPT-4 outperforming other models tested. When used with a well-designed prompt, GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable hints. A multi-stage prompt was the most effective LLM prompt. We found that the two most important factors of a good hint were length (80--160 words being best), and reading level (US grade 9 or below being best). Offering alternative approaches to solving the problem was considered bad, and we found no effect of sentiment.
  Conclusions: Automatic generation of these hints is immediately viable, given that LLMs outperformed humans -- even when the students' task is unknown. The fact that only the best prompts achieve this outcome suggests that students on their own are unlikely to be able to produce the same benefit. The prompting task, therefore, should be embedded in an expert-designed tool.</description>

      <title>MSA-ASR: Efficient Multilingual Speaker Attribution with frozen ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) aims to transcribe speech while assigning transcripts to the corresponding speakers accurately. Existing methods often rely on complex modular systems or require extensive fine-tuning of joint modules, limiting their adaptability and general efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach, leveraging a frozen multilingual ASR model to incorporate speaker attribution into the transcriptions, using only standard monolingual ASR datasets. Our method involves training a speaker module to predict speaker embeddings based on weak labels without requiring additional ASR model modifications. Despite being trained exclusively with non-overlapping monolingual data, our approach effectively extracts speaker attributes across diverse multilingual datasets, including those with overlapping speech. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance compared to strong baselines, highlighting the model's robustness and potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Rate-Compatible Linear Block Codes: An Auto-Encoder Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) provides an alternative way to design channel coding with affordable complexity. However, most existing studies can only learn codes for a given size and rate, typically defined by a fixed network architecture and a set of parameters. The support of multiple code rates is essential for conserving bandwidth under varying channel conditions while it is costly to store multiple AI models or parameter sets. In this article, we propose an auto-encoder (AE) based rate-compatible linear block codes (RC-LBCs). The coding process associated with AI or non-AI decoders and multiple puncturing patterns is optimized in a data-driven manner. The superior performance of the proposed AI-based RC-LBC is demonstrated through our numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to obtain closed form solutions for the semiclassical (or WKB) approximation of the heat kernel propagator of the diffusion equation defined by the constant elasticity variance (CEV) option pricing model. One of the key points is that our calculations are based on the Van Vleck-Morette determinant instead of the Van Vleck determinant used by other authors. In fact, we compute this determinant in two different ways: by means of the solution of the classical Hamiltonian equations, and by solving the variational equations. Furthermore, the calculation reveals an exponential factor in the prefactor of the kernel not considered in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Besov regularity of wavelet series on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with randomly chosen coefficients. More precisely, each coefficient is a product of a random factor and a parameterized deterministic factor (decaying with the scale $j$ and the norm of the shift $m$). Compared to the literature, we impose relatively mild conditions on the moments of the random variables in order to characterize the almost sure convergence of the wavelet series in Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and the finiteness of the moments as well as of the moment generating function of the Besov norm. In most cases, we achieve a complete characterization, i.e., the derived conditions are both necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <title>Realization of a one-dimensional topological insulator in ultrathin germanene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing a one-dimensional (1D) topological insulator and identifying the lower dimensional limit of two-dimensional (2D) behavior are crucial steps toward developing high-density quantum state networks, advancing topological quantum computing, and exploring dimensionality effects in topological materials. Although 2D topological insulators have been experimentally realized, their lower dimensional limit and 1D counterparts remain elusive. Here, we fabricated and characterized arrays of zigzag-terminated germanene nanoribbons, a 2D topological insulator with a large topological bulk gap. The electronic properties of these nanoribbons strongly depend on their width, with topological edge states persisting down to a critical width (approx. 2 nm), defining the limit of 2D topology. Below this threshold, contrary to the tenfold way classification, we observe zero-dimensional (0D) states localized at the ends of the ultrathin nanoribbons. These end states, topologically protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries, mark the first realization of a 1D topological insulator with strong spin-orbit coupling. Our findings establish germanene nanoribbons as a platform for investigating 1D topology and dimensionality effects in topological materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comprehensive survey delves into the latest advancements in Relation Extraction (RE), a pivotal task in natural language processing essential for applications across biomedical, financial, and legal sectors. This study highlights the evolution and current state of RE techniques by analyzing 137 papers presented at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conferences over the past four years, focusing on models that leverage language models. Our findings underscore the dominance of BERT-based methods in achieving state-of-the-art results for RE while also noting the promising capabilities of emerging large language models (LLMs) like T5, especially in few-shot relation extraction scenarios where they excel in identifying previously unseen relations.</description>

      <title>Abductive Symbolic Solver on Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing artificial intelligence reasoning capabilities, focusing on logicality within the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Humans solve such visual reasoning tasks based on their observations and hypotheses, and they can explain their solutions with a proper reason. However, many previous approaches focused only on the grid transition and it is not enough for AI to provide reasonable and human-like solutions. By considering the human process of solving visual reasoning tasks, we have concluded that the thinking process is likely the abductive reasoning process. Thus, we propose a novel framework that symbolically represents the observed data into a knowledge graph and extracts core knowledge that can be used for solution generation. This information limits the solution search space and helps provide a reasonable mid-process. Our approach holds promise for improving AI performance on ARC tasks by effectively narrowing the solution space and providing logical solutions grounded in core knowledge extraction.</description>

      <title>Type-R: Automatically Retouching Typos for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent text-to-image models can generate photorealistic images from text prompts that reflect detailed instructions, they still face significant challenges in accurately rendering words in the image. In this paper, we propose to retouch erroneous text renderings in the post-processing pipeline. Our approach, called Type-R, identifies typographical errors in the generated image, erases the erroneous text, regenerates text boxes for missing words, and finally corrects typos in the rendered words. Through extensive experiments, we show that Type-R, in combination with the latest text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion or Flux, achieves the highest text rendering accuracy while maintaining image quality and also outperforms text-focused generation baselines in terms of balancing text accuracy and image quality.</description>

      <title>Detecting Standard Model Gauge Group from Generalized Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics stands as one of the most profound and successful frameworks for describing the fundamental workings of nature. The global form of the Standard Model gauge group, however, remains an open question: it can be $\left(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\right)/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma=1,\mathbb{Z}_2,\mathbb{Z}_3$ or $\mathbb{Z}_6$. The work introduces the fractional topological transport coefficient $\xi$ involving the $U(1)$ B-L symmetry and the $U(1)$ one-form magnetic symmetry of the renormalizable Standard Model, and show that it distinguishes the global form of the Standard Model gauge group. The gauge group is fully determined for specific values of $\xi$, which also depends on the choice of action of the B-L symmetry on the Standard Model known as a fractionalization class. This transport coefficient can be measured in a contact term for the two-point function of the B-L symmetry current with the magnetic one-form symmetry current of the Standard Model. This parallels topological transport in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, with quarks and the B-L symmetry playing the role of anyons and the $U(1)$ electromagnetic global symmetry respectively.</description>

      <title>The Rn-index: a more accurate variant of the Rk-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution to pushing the boundaries of knowledge is a critical metric for evaluating the research performance of countries and institutions, which in many cases is not revealed by common bibliometric indicators. The Rk-index was specifically designed to assess such contributions, and the Rn-index is a variant that corrects the weakness of the Rk-index, particularly in the evaluation of countries that produce a high proportion of global advancements. This is the case of the USA and China in many technological fields. Additionally, the Rn-index is simple to calculate and understand, as it involves only summing the ratios between the local and global ranks of papers, ordered by their citation count. Moreover, the Rn-index may also be fractionally counted.</description>

      <title>SentiXRL: An advanced large language Model Framework for Multilingual Fine-Grained Emotion Classification in Complex Text Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With strong expressive capabilities in Large Language Models(LLMs), generative models effectively capture sentiment structures and deep semantics, however, challenges remain in fine-grained sentiment classification across multi-lingual and complex contexts. To address this, we propose the Sentiment Cross-Lingual Recognition and Logic Framework (SentiXRL), which incorporates two modules,an emotion retrieval enhancement module to improve sentiment classification accuracy in complex contexts through historical dialogue and logical reasoning,and a self-circulating analysis negotiation mechanism (SANM)to facilitates autonomous decision-making within a single model for classification tasks.We have validated SentiXRL's superiority on multiple standard datasets, outperforming existing models on CPED and CH-SIMS,and achieving overall better performance on MELD,Emorynlp and IEMOCAP. Notably, we unified labels across several fine-grained sentiment annotation datasets and conducted category confusion experiments, revealing challenges and impacts of class imbalance in standard datasets.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{T}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness of the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ for general dimensions. This result is new for dimensions $d\ge5$, extending previous results for $d=3,4$ [10,22]. Compared to the cases $d=3,4$, the regularity theory for higher $d$, developed in the underlying local well-posedness result [17], is less understood. In particular, stability theory and inverse inequalities, which are ingredients in [10,22] and more generally in the widely used concentration compactness framework since [13], are too weak to be applied to higher dimensions.
  Our proof introduces a new strategy for addressing global well-posedness problems. Without relying on perturbation theory, we develop tools to analyze the concentration dynamics of the nonlinear flow. On the way, we show the formation of a nontrivial concentration.</description>

      <title>RPEE-HEADS: A Novel Benchmark for Pedestrian Head Detection in Crowd Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic detection of pedestrian heads in crowded environments is essential for crowd analysis and management tasks, particularly in high-risk settings such as railway platforms and event entrances. These environments, characterized by dense crowds and dynamic movements, are underrepresented in public datasets, posing challenges for existing deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce the Railway Platforms and Event Entrances-Heads (RPEE-Heads) dataset, a novel, diverse, high-resolution, and accurately annotated resource. It includes 109,913 annotated pedestrian heads across 1,886 images from 66 video recordings, with an average of 56.2 heads per image. Annotations include bounding boxes for visible head regions. In addition to introducing the RPEE-Heads dataset, this paper evaluates eight state-of-the-art object detection algorithms using the RPEE-Heads dataset and analyzes the impact of head size on detection accuracy. The experimental results show that You Only Look Once v9 and Real-Time Detection Transformer outperform the other algorithms, achieving mean average precisions of 90.7% and 90.8%, with inference times of 11 and 14 milliseconds, respectively. Moreover, the findings underscore the need for specialized datasets like RPEE-Heads for training and evaluating accurate models for head detection in railway platforms and event entrances. The dataset and pretrained models are available at https://doi.org/10.34735/ped.2024.2.</description>

      <title>KAN See Your Face</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of face reconstruction (FR) systems, privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) has gained popularity for its secure face recognition, enhanced facial privacy protection, and robustness to various attacks. Besides, specific models and algorithms are proposed for face embedding protection by mapping embeddings to a secure space. However, there is a lack of studies on investigating and evaluating the possibility of extracting face images from embeddings of those systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we introduce the first approach to exploit Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting embedding-to-face attacks against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Face embedding mapping (FEM) models are proposed to learn the distribution mapping relation between the embeddings from the initial domain and target domain. In comparison with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), we provide two variants, FEM-KAN and FEM-MLP, for efficient non-linear embedding-to-embedding mapping in order to reconstruct realistic face images from the corresponding face embedding. To verify our methods, we conduct extensive experiments with various PPFR and FR models. We also measure reconstructed face images with different metrics to evaluate the image quality. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FEMs in accurate embedding mapping and face reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Combined Learning of Linear Parameter-Varying Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical models identified from data are frequently employed in control system design. However, decoupling system identification from controller synthesis can result in situations where no suitable controller exists after a model has been identified. In this work, we introduce a novel control-oriented regularization in the identification procedure to ensure the existence of a controller that can enforce constraints on system variables robustly. The combined identification algorithm includes: (i) the concurrent learning of an uncertain model and a nominal model using an observer; (ii) a regularization term on the model parameters defined as the size of the largest robust control invariant set for the uncertain model. To make the learning problem tractable, we consider nonlinear models in quasi Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) form, utilizing a novel scheduling function parameterization that facilitates the derivation of an associated uncertain linear model. The robust control invariant set is represented as a polytope, and we adopt novel results from polytope geometry to derive the regularization function as the optimal value of a convex quadratic program. Additionally, we present new model-reduction approaches that exploit the chosen model structure. Numerical examples on classical identification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A simple control scheme is also derived to provide an example of data-driven control of a constrained nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing of a frustrated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing, which involves quantum tunnelling among possible solutions, has state-of-the-art applications not only in quickly finding the lowest-energy configuration of a complex system, but also in quantum computing. Here we report a single-crystal study of the frustrated magnet $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$, consisting of a triangular arrangement of ferromagnetic Ising spin chains without evident structural disorder. We observe quantum annealing phenomena resulting from time-reversal symmetry breaking in a tiny transverse field. Below $\sim$ 1 K, the system exhibits no indication of approaching the lowest-energy state for at least 15 hours in zero transverse field, but quickly converges towards that configuration with a nearly temperature-independent relaxation time of $\sim$ 10 seconds in a transverse field of $\sim$ 3.5 mK. Our many-body simulations show qualitative agreement with the experimental results, and suggest that a tiny transverse field can profoundly enhance quantum spin fluctuations, triggering rapid quantum annealing process from topological metastable Kosterlitz-Thouless phases, at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we developed an efficient quantum algorithm for the simulation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, based on the Feynman path integral formulation. The algorithm scales polynomially with the number of native gates and the number of qubits, and has no classical overhead. It demonstrates the quantum advantage by overcoming the exponential cost on classical computers. In addition, the algorithm is efficient regardless of whether the temporal entanglement due to non-Markovianity is low or high, making it a unified framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum system.</description>

      <title>PDZSeg: Adapting the Foundation Model for Dissection Zone Segmentation with Visual Prompts in Robot-assisted Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Endoscopic surgical environments present challenges for dissection zone segmentation due to unclear boundaries between tissue types, leading to segmentation errors where models misidentify or overlook edges. This study aims to provide precise dissection zone suggestions during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedures, enhancing ESD safety.
  Methods: We propose the Prompted-based Dissection Zone Segmentation (PDZSeg) model, designed to leverage diverse visual prompts such as scribbles and bounding boxes. By overlaying these prompts onto images and fine-tuning a foundational model on a specialized dataset, our approach improves segmentation performance and user experience through flexible input methods.
  Results: The PDZSeg model was validated using three experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, variability in visual prompt availability, and robustness assessment. Using the ESD-DZSeg dataset, results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. This is the first study to integrate visual prompt design into dissection zone segmentation.
  Conclusion: The PDZSeg model effectively utilizes visual prompts to enhance segmentation performance and user experience, supported by the novel ESD-DZSeg dataset as a benchmark for dissection zone segmentation in ESD. Our work establishes a foundation for future research.</description>

Abstract: We present our preliminary results on the machine learning estimation of $\text{Tr} \, M^{-n}$ from other observables with the gradient boosting decision tree regression, where $M$ is the Dirac operator. Ordinarily, $\text{Tr} \, M^{-n}$ is obtained by linear CG solver for stochastic sources which needs considerable computational cost. Hence, we explore the possibility of cost reduction on the trace estimation by the adoption of gradient boosting decision tree algorithm. We also discuss effects of bias and its correction.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic distribution of Elkies primes for reductions of abelian varieties is Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of Elkies primes for elliptic curves to the setting of abelian varieties with real multiplication (RM), and prove the following. Let $A$ be an abelian variety with RM over a number field whose attached Galois representation has large image. Then the number of Elkies primes (in a suitable range) for reductions of $A$ modulo primes converges weakly to a Gaussian distribution around its expected value. This refines and generalizes results obtained by Shparlinski and Sutherland in the case of non-CM elliptic curves, and has implications for the complexity of the SEA point counting algorithm for abelian surfaces over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks excel at identifying individual components in an image. However, out-of-the-box, they do not manage to correctly integrate and interpret these components as a whole. One way to alleviate this weakness is to expand the network with explicit knowledge and a separate reasoning component. In this paper, we evaluate an approach to this end, applied to the solving of the popular board game Rummikub. We demonstrate that, for this particular example, the added background knowledge is equally valuable as two-thirds of the data set, and allows to bring down the training time to half the original time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon-Boussinesq (KGB) system is proposed in the literature as a model problem to study the validity of approximations in the long wave limit provided by simpler equations such as KdV, nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger or Whitham equations. In this paper, the KGB system is analyzed as a mathematical model in three specific points. The first one concerns well-posedness of the initial-value problem with the study of local existence and uniqueness of solution and the conditions under which the local solution is global or blows up at finite time. The second point is focused on traveling wave solutions of the KGB system. The existence of different types of solitary waves is derived from two classical approaches, while from their numerical generation several properties of the solitary wave profiles are studied. In addition, the validity of the KdV approximation is analyzed by computational means and from the corresponding KdV soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>ORB-SLAM3AB: Augmenting ORB-SLAM3 to Counteract Bumps with Optical Flow Inter-frame Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an enhancement to the ORB-SLAM3 algorithm, tailored for applications on rugged road surfaces. Our improved algorithm adeptly combines feature point matching with optical flow methods, capitalizing on the high robustness of optical flow in complex terrains and the high precision of feature points on smooth surfaces. By refining the inter-frame matching logic of ORB-SLAM3, we have addressed the issue of frame matching loss on uneven roads. To prevent a decrease in accuracy, an adaptive matching mechanism has been incorporated, which increases the reliance on optical flow points during periods of high vibration, thereby effectively maintaining SLAM precision. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of multi-sensor datasets suitable for environments with bumpy roads or speed bumps, we have collected LiDAR and camera data from such settings. Our enhanced algorithm, ORB-SLAM3AB, was then benchmarked against several advanced open-source SLAM algorithms that rely solely on laser or visual data. Through the analysis of Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE) metrics, our results demonstrate that ORB-SLAM3AB achieves superior robustness and accuracy on rugged road surfaces.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Signature of Local Alloy Fluctuations in InGaN/GaN Multi-Quantum-Disk Light Emitting Diode Heterostructures and Its Impact on the Optical Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneity-governed carrier localization has been investigated in three sets of InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-disk light-emitting diode (LED) structures grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) under different process conditions. A temperature-dependent study of the luminescence peak positions reveals that samples prepared under certain process conditions exhibit a thermal distribution of carriers from the localized states that show the typical S-shaped dependence in luminescence characteristics. The absence of an S-shaped nature in the other sample prepared with relatively higher In-flux infers a superior homogeneity in alloy composition. Further investigation manifested superior optical properties for the samples where the S-shape nature is found to be absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a finite equational presentation of graphs of treewidth at most three, solving an instanceof an open problem by Courcelle and Engelfriet.We use a syntax generalising series-parallel expressions, denoting graphs with a small interface.We introduce appropriate notions of connectivity for such graphs (components, cutvertices, separationpairs). We use those concepts to analyse the structure of graphs of treewidth at most three, showinghow they can be decomposed recursively, first canonically into connected parallel components, andthen non-deterministically. The main difficulty consists in showing that all non-deterministic choicescan be related using only finitely many equational axioms.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning reveals that the Gender-based Violence Victim Condition can be detected from Speech in a Speaker-Agnostic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical issue of gender-based violence's (GBV) impact on women's mental health. GBV, encompassing physical and sexual aggression, often results in long-lasting adverse effects for the victims, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based speech technologies have proven valuable for mental health assessments. However, these technologies experience performance challenges when confronted with speakers whose data has not been used for training.
  Our research presents a novel approach to speaker-agnostic detection of the gender-based violence victim condition (GBVVC), focusing on the development of robust AI models capable of generalization across diverse speakers. Leveraging advanced deep learning models and domain-adversarial training techniques, we minimize speaker identity's influence, achieving a 26.95% relative reduction in speaker identification ability while enhancing the GBVVC detection by a 6.37% relative improvement in the accuracy. This shows that models can focus on discriminative paralinguistic biomarkers that enhance the GBVVC prediction, and reduce the subject-specific traits' impact.
  Additionally, our model's predictions moderately correlate with pre-clinical PTSD symptoms, emphasizing the link between GBV and mental health. This work paves the way for AI-powered tools to aid mental health professionals in addressing this societal issue, offering a promising baseline for further research.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Flexibility in Power Systems by Maximizing the Region of Manageable Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing need to hedge against load and generation uncertainty in the operation of power grids, we propose flexibility maximization during operation.
  We consider flexibility explicitly as the amount of uncertainty that can be handled while still ensuring nominal grid operation in the worst-case. We apply the proposed flexibility optimization in the context of a DC flow approximation. By using a corresponding parameterization, we can find the maximal range of uncertainty and a range for the manageable power transfer between two parts of a network subject to uncertainty.
  We formulate the corresponding optimization problem as an (existence-constrained) semi-infinite optimization problem and specialize an existing algorithm for its solution.</description>

      <title>Prediction with Action: Visual Policy Learning via Joint Denoising Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation tasks, including image editing and video creation, representing a good understanding of the physical world. On the other line, diffusion models have also shown promise in robotic control tasks by denoising actions, known as diffusion policy. Although the diffusion generative model and diffusion policy exhibit distinct capabilities--image prediction and robotic action, respectively--they technically follow a similar denoising process. In robotic tasks, the ability to predict future images and generate actions is highly correlated since they share the same underlying dynamics of the physical world. Building on this insight, we introduce PAD, a novel visual policy learning framework that unifies image Prediction and robot Action within a joint Denoising process. Specifically, PAD utilizes Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to seamlessly integrate images and robot states, enabling the simultaneous prediction of future images and robot actions. Additionally, PAD supports co-training on both robotic demonstrations and large-scale video datasets and can be easily extended to other robotic modalities, such as depth images. PAD outperforms previous methods, achieving a significant 26.3% relative improvement on the full Metaworld benchmark, by utilizing a single text-conditioned visual policy within a data-efficient imitation learning setting. Furthermore, PAD demonstrates superior generalization to unseen tasks in real-world robot manipulation settings with 28.0% success rate increase compared to the strongest baseline.

      <title>DistinctAD: Distinctive Audio Description Generation in Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) aim to provide a narration of a movie in text form, describing non-dialogue-related narratives, such as characters, actions, or scene establishment. Automatic generation of ADs remains challenging due to: i) the domain gap between movie-AD data and existing data used to train vision-language models, and ii) the issue of contextual redundancy arising from highly similar neighboring visual clips in a long movie. In this work, we propose DistinctAD, a novel two-stage framework for generating ADs that emphasize distinctiveness to produce better narratives. To address the domain gap, we introduce a CLIP-AD adaptation strategy that does not require additional AD corpora, enabling more effective alignment between movie and AD modalities at both global and fine-grained levels. In Stage-II, DistinctAD incorporates two key innovations: (i) a Contextual Expectation-Maximization Attention (EMA) module that reduces redundancy by extracting common bases from consecutive video clips, and (ii) an explicit distinctive word prediction loss that filters out repeated words in the context, ensuring the prediction of unique terms specific to the current AD. Comprehensive evaluations on MAD-Eval, CMD-AD, and TV-AD benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DistinctAD, with the model consistently outperforming baselines, particularly in Recall@k/N, highlighting its effectiveness in producing high-quality, distinctive ADs.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering the Milky Way with orbit superposition approach and APOGEE data III. Panoramic view of the bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innermost parts of the Milky Way (MW) are very difficult to observe due to the high extinction along the line of sight, especially close to the disc mid-plane. However, this region contains the most massive complex stellar component of the MW, the bulge, primarily composed of disc stars whose structure is (re-)shaped by the evolution of the bar. In this work, we extend the application of the orbit superposition method to explore the present-day 3D structure, orbital composition, chemical abundance trends and kinematics of the MW bulge. Thanks to our approach, we are able to transfer astrometry from Gaia and stellar parameters from APOGEE DR 17 to map the inner MW without obscuration by the survey footprint and selection function. We demonstrate that the MW bulge is made of two main populations originating from a metal-poor, high-{\alpha} thick disc and a metal-rich, low-{\alpha} thin disc, with a mass ratio of 4:3, seen as two major components in the MDF. Finer MDF structures hint at multiple sub-populations associated with different orbital families of the bulge, which, however, have broad MDFs themselves. Decomposition using 2D GMMs in [Fe/H] -[Mg/Fe] identifies five components including a population with ex-situ origin. Two dominant ones correspond to the thin and thick discs and two in between trace the transition between them. We show that no universal metallicity gradient value can characterise the MW bulge. The radial gradients closely trace the X-shaped bulge density structure, while the vertical gradient variations follow the boxy component. While having, on average, subsolar metallicity, the MW bulge populations are more metal-rich compared to the surrounding disc, in agreement with extragalactic observations and state-of-the-art simulations reinforcing its secular origin.</description>

      <title>Equi join query acceleration using algebraic signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of join queries is very challenging since they have to deal with an increasing data size. We study the relational join query processing realized by hash tables and we focus on the case of equi join queries. We propose to use a new form of signatures, the algebraic signatures, for fast comparison between values of two attributes in relations participating in an equi join operations. Our technique is efficient especially when the attribute join is a long string. In this paper, we investigate this issue and prove that algebraic signatures combined to known hash join technique constitute an efficient method to accelerate equi join operations. Algebraic signatures allow fast string search. They are descending from the Karp-Rabin signatures. String matching using our algebraic calculus is then several times faster comparing to the fastest known methods, e.g. Boyer Moore.We justify our approach and present an experimental evaluation. We also present a cost analysis for an equi join operation using algebraic signatures. The performance evaluation of our technique shows the improvement of query processing times. We also discuss the reductions of required memory sizes and the disk I/O. The main contribution of this paper is the using of algebraic signatures to accelerate equi join operations especially when the attribute join is a long string and to avoid multiples I/O disk by reduce memory requirement.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic well-posedness of generalized cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with strong dispersion using higher order expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local well-posedness of the cubic Schr\"odinger equation $$(i\partial_t + \mathcal{L}) u = \pm |u|^2 u \qquad \textrm{on} \quad \ I\times \mathbb{R}^d ,$$ with initial data being a Wiener randomization at unit scale of a given function $f$ and $\mathcal{L}$ being an operator of degree $\sigma\geq 2$. In particular, we prove that a solution exists almost-surely locally in time provided $f\in H^{S}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ with $S&gt;\frac{2-\sigma}{4}$ for $d\leq \frac{3\sigma}{2}$, i.e. even if the initial datum is taken in certain negative order Sobolev spaces. The solutions are constructed as a sum of an explicit multilinear expansion of the flow in terms of the random initial data and of an additional smoother remainder term with deterministically subcritical regularity. We develop the framework of directional space-time norms to control the (probabilistic) multilinear expansion and the (deterministic) remainder term and to obtain improved bilinear probabilistic-deterministic Strichartz estimates.</description>

Abstract: Localized nonlinear losses are taken into account in a simple Raman clarinet model.The complete system is expressed as an iterated map, enabling to study the stability of the different playing regimes. A parametric study is carried out with respect to three major parameters: blowing pressure, embouchure and nonlinear losses coefficient.The model exhibits the well-known effect of reducing the extinction threshold when nonlinear losses increase.However, the stability analysis also shows that increasing nonlinear losses increases the oscillation threshold.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\''odinger equation on a strip with Neumann boundary conditions and a delta condition on the $x$-axis. First, we show the existence of ground states as minimizers of the action or of the energy under suitable constraints. Second, we prove that the energy minimizers converge to the ground state on the line with a delta condition as the amplitude of the strip shrinks to zero.</description>

      <title>Towards Lensless Image Deblurring with Prior-Embedded Implicit Neural Representations in the Low-Data Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of computational imaging has witnessed a promising paradigm shift with the emergence of untrained neural networks, offering novel solutions to inverse computational imaging problems. While existing techniques have demonstrated impressive results, they often operate either in the high-data regime, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as image priors, or through untrained iterative reconstruction in a data-agnostic manner. This paper delves into lensless image reconstruction, a subset of computational imaging that replaces traditional lenses with computation, enabling the development of ultra-thin and lightweight imaging systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage implicit neural representations for lensless image deblurring, achieving reconstructions without the requirement of prior training. We perform prior-embedded untrained iterative optimization to enhance reconstruction performance and speed up convergence, effectively bridging the gap between the no-data and high-data regimes. Through a thorough comparative analysis encompassing various untrained and low-shot methods, including under-parameterized non-convolutional methods and domain-restricted low-shot methods, we showcase the superior performance of our approach by a significant margin.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the distribution of fireballs produced in heavy-ion collisions in the net-baryon number and argue that neither the Free-Quark Model (FQM) nor the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model can provide a comprehensive explanation of the distribution observed at the LHC. The concept of net-baryon number freezeout temperature is suggested and the role of sea quarks as a possible source of net-baryon number fluctuations is emphasized.</description>

      <title>InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint. In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the regularisation of a differential system related to generalised Krawtchouk polynomials. We show a straightforward connection between certain auxiliary quantities involving the recurrence coefficients of these polynomials and Painlev\'e V equation via iterative regularisation. Furthermore, we explore how iterative regularisation yields polynomial systems and enables us to find decompositions of certain birational transformations.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Solar Prominence Formation Triggered by Single Localized Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations to study mechanisms of solar prominence formation triggered by a single heating event. In the widely accepted ``chromospheric-evaporation condensation" model, localized heating at footpoints of a coronal loop drives plasma evaporation and eventually triggers condensation. The occurrence of condensation is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the heating.Various theoretical studies have been conducted along one-dimensional field lines with quasi-steady localized heating. The quasi-steady heating is regarded as the collection of multiple heating events among multiple strands constituting a coronal loop. However, it is reasonable to consider a single heating event along a single field line as an elemental unit.We investigated the condensation phenomenon triggered by a single heating event using 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By varying the magnitude of the localized heating rate, we explored the conditions necessary for condensation. We found that when a heating rate approximately $\sim 10^{4}$ times greater than that of steady heating was applied, condensation occurred. Condensation was observed when the thermal conduction efficiency in the loop became lower than the cooling efficiency, with the cooling rate significantly exceeding the heating rate. Using the loop length $L$ and the Field length $\lambda_{\mathrm{F}}$, the condition for condensation is expressed as $\lambda_{\mathrm{F}} \lesssim L/2$ under conditions where cooling exceeds heating. We extended the analytically derived condition for thermal non-equilibrium to a formulation based on heating amount.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Fairness Guarantees using Lorenz Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to learn a set of policies that optimize trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting objectives. MORL is computationally more complex than single-objective RL, particularly as the number of objectives increases. Additionally, when objectives involve the preferences of agents or groups, ensuring fairness is socially desirable. This paper introduces a principled algorithm that incorporates fairness into MORL while improving scalability to many-objective problems. We propose using Lorenz dominance to identify policies with equitable reward distributions and introduce {\lambda}-Lorenz dominance to enable flexible fairness preferences. We release a new, large-scale real-world transport planning environment and demonstrate that our method encourages the discovery of fair policies, showing improved scalability in two large cities (Xi'an and Amsterdam). Our methods outperform common multi-objective approaches, particularly in high-dimensional objective spaces.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Controlled Teleportation across Distributed Nodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed work employs n instances of m-qubit GHZ states as the quantum resource to facilitate the teleportation of arbitrary n-qubit states among m participants, enabling the design of a teleportation protocol for distributed nodes across a network. The measurement operations of the sender are modified to ensure all measurements are local, and this modification is generalized to accommodate m participants in a 1-qubit teleportation protocol. Further extensions adapt the protocol to support n-qubit teleportation via m participants. Various configurations of the generalized protocol are explored, and the fidelity of teleportation is assessed through a comparative analysis of the Hinton diagrams of the input and output states.</description>

      <title>Make-It-Animatable: An Efficient Framework for Authoring Animation-Ready 3D Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D characters are essential to modern creative industries, but making them animatable often demands extensive manual work in tasks like rigging and skinning. Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our framework's effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quality and speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Black hole mass estimation using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed feeding and feedback mechanisms of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are not yet well known. For low-luminosity and obscured AGN, as well as late-type galaxies, determining the central black hole (BH) masses is challenging. Our goal with the GATOS sample is to study circum-nuclear regions and better estimate BH masses with more precision than scaling relations offer. Using ALMA's high spatial resolution, we resolve CO(3-2) emissions within ~100 pc around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in seven GATOS galaxies to estimate their BH masses when sufficient gas is present. We study seven bright ($L_{AGN}(14-150\mathrm{keV}) \geq 10^{42}\mathrm{erg/s}$), nearby (&lt;28 Mpc) galaxies from the GATOS core sample. For comparison, we searched the literature for previous BH mass estimates and made additional calculations using the \mbh~ - $\sigma$ relation and the fundamental plane of BH activity. We developed a supervised machine learning method to estimate BH masses from position-velocity diagrams or first-moment maps using ALMA CO(3-2) observations. Numerical simulations with a wide range of parameters created the training, validation, and test sets. Seven galaxies provided enough gas for BH mass estimations: NGC4388, NGC5506, NGC5643, NGC6300, NGC7314, NGC7465, and NGC~7582. Our BH masses, ranging from 6.39 to 7.18 log$(M_{BH}/M_\odot)$, align with previous estimates. Additionally, our machine learning method provides robust error estimations with confidence intervals and offers greater potential than scaling relations. This work is a first step toward an automated \mbh estimation method using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Learning for Long-Horizon Planning via Neuro-Symbolic Abductive Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent learning-to-imitation methods have shown promising results in planning via imitating within the observation-action space. However, their ability in open environments remains constrained, particularly in long-horizon tasks. In contrast, traditional symbolic planning excels in long-horizon tasks through logical reasoning over human-defined symbolic spaces but struggles to handle observations beyond symbolic states, such as high-dimensional visual inputs encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we draw inspiration from abductive learning and introduce a novel framework \textbf{AB}ductive \textbf{I}mitation \textbf{L}earning (ABIL) that integrates the benefits of data-driven learning and symbolic-based reasoning, enabling long-horizon planning. Specifically, we employ abductive reasoning to understand the demonstrations in symbolic space and design the principles of sequential consistency to resolve the conflicts between perception and reasoning. ABIL generates predicate candidates to facilitate the perception from raw observations to symbolic space without laborious predicate annotations, providing a groundwork for symbolic planning. With the symbolic understanding, we further develop a policy ensemble whose base policies are built with different logical objectives and managed through symbolic reasoning. Experiments show that our proposal successfully understands the observations with the task-relevant symbolics to assist the imitation learning. Importantly, ABIL demonstrates significantly improved data efficiency and generalization across various long-horizon tasks, highlighting it as a promising solution for long-horizon planning.

      <description>arXiv:2411.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coupling between magnons and phonons requires material platforms that contain magnetic multilayers with versatile high-frequency properties grown on piezoelectric substrates with large electromechanical coupling coefficients. One of these systems is the CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB Synthetic antiferromagnet grown on Lithium Niobate substrate. We investigate its microwave magnetic properties using a combination of ferromagnetic resonance and propagating spin wave spectroscopy, from which we extract the dispersion relation of the acoustic branch of spin waves. The frequency and the linewidth of this spin wave resonance, its field dependence and its dispersion relation indicate that the magnetic properties are as good as when grown on standard non-piezoelectric substrates, as well as being in line with theory. This new material platform opens opportunities to extend microwave acousto-magnonics beyond the use of single layer magnets.</description>

      <title>Critic-V: VLM Critics Help Catch VLM Errors in Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models~(VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>The ViCTORIA project: description of a multi-frequency radio survey of the Virgo galaxy cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo cluster is the closest richest nearby galaxy cluster. It is in the formation process, with a number of sub-clusters undergoing merging and interactions. Although a great laboratory to study galaxy evolution and cluster formation, its large apparent size and the severe dynamic range limitations due to the presence of the bright radio source Virgo A (M 87) reduced the ability of past wide-area radio surveys to image the region with high sensitivity and fidelity. In this paper we describe the "Virgo Cluster multi-Telescope Observations in Radio of Interacting galaxies and AGN" (ViCTORIA) project. The survey and its data reduction strategy are designed to mitigate the challenges of this field and deliver: images from 42 MHz to 1.7 GHz frequencies of the Virgo cluster, about 60 times deeper than existing data, in full polarisation, and including a blind HI survey that aims at mapping seven times more galaxies than previous experiments and without selection biases. Data have been collected with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) and with MeerKAT in L-band, including polarisation and enough frequency resolution to conduct local HI studies. At the distance of Virgo, current radio instruments have the resolution to probe scales of ~500 pc and the sensitivity to study dwarf galaxies, the most fragile systems given their shallow gravitational potential wells, making Virgo a unique laboratory to study galaxy evolution and AGN feedback in a rich environment. In this work, we present some preliminary results, including high resolution images of the radio emission surrounding M 87, that show that the lobes are filled with filamentary structures. The combination of the presented radio surveys with state-of-the-art optical, UV, X-ray surveys will massively increase the scientific output from the studies of the Virgo cluster, making the ViCTORIA Project's legacy value outstanding.</description>

      <title>Nature of metallic and insulating domains in the CDW system 1T-TaSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of bulk 1T-TaSe$_2$ in the charge density wave phase at low temperature. Our spatially and angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) data show insulating areas coexisting with metallic regions characterized by a chiral Fermi surface and moderately correlated quasiparticle bands. Additionally, high-resolution laser ARPES reveals variations in the metallic regions, with series of low-energy states, whose energy, number and dispersion can be explained by the formation of quantum well states of different thicknesses. Dynamical mean field theory calculations show that the observed rich behaviour can be rationalized by assuming occasional stacking faults of the charge density wave. Our results indicate that the diverse electronic phenomena reported previously in 1T-TaSe$_2$ are dictated by the stacking arrangement and the resulting quantum size effects while correlation effects play a secondary role.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transfer Learning for Astronomical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of astronomical data from large-scale surveys has created both opportunities and challenges for the astrophysics community. This paper explores the possibilities offered by transfer learning techniques in addressing these challenges across various domains of astronomical research. We present a set of recent applications of transfer learning methods for astronomical tasks based on the usage of a pre-trained convolutional neural networks. The examples shortly discussed include the detection of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN), the possibility of deriving physical parameters for galaxies directly from images, the identification of artifacts in time series images, and the detection of strong lensing candidates and outliers. We demonstrate how transfer learning enables efficient analysis of complex astronomical phenomena, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This kind of method will be very helpful for upcoming large-scale surveys like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). By showcasing successful implementations and discussing methodological approaches, we highlight the versatility and effectiveness of such techniques.</description>

      <title>From Open Vocabulary to Open World: Teaching Vision Language Models to Detect Novel Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional object detection methods operate under the closed-set assumption, where models can only detect a fixed number of objects predefined in the training set. Recent works on open vocabulary object detection (OVD) enable the detection of objects defined by an unbounded vocabulary, which reduces the cost of training models for specific tasks. However, OVD heavily relies on accurate prompts provided by an ''oracle'', which limits their use in critical applications such as driving scene perception. OVD models tend to misclassify near-out-of-distribution (NOOD) objects that have similar semantics to known classes, and ignore far-out-of-distribution (FOOD) objects. To address theses limitations, we propose a framework that enables OVD models to operate in open world settings, by identifying and incrementally learning novel objects. To detect FOOD objects, we propose Open World Embedding Learning (OWEL) and introduce the concept of Pseudo Unknown Embedding which infers the location of unknown classes in a continuous semantic space based on the information of known classes. We also propose Multi-Scale Contrastive Anchor Learning (MSCAL), which enables the identification of misclassified unknown objects by promoting the intra-class consistency of object embeddings at different scales. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in common open world object detection and autonomous driving benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Measurements of $t\bar{t}$ in association with charm quarks at 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This talk presents the ATLAS Collaboration's first measurement of the inclusive cross-section for top-quark pair production in association with charm quarks. Using the full Run 2 proton-proton collision data sample at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC between 2015 and 2018, the measurement selects $t\bar{t}$ events with one or two charged leptons and at least one additional jet in the final state. A custom flavour-tagging algorithm is employed to simultaneously identify $b$-jets and $c$-jets. The fiducial cross-sections for $t\bar{t}+{\geq}2c$ and $t\bar{t}+1c$ production are found to largely agree with predictions from various $t\bar{t}$ simulations, though all underpredict the observed values.</description>

      <title>A rational Krylov methods for large scale linear multidimensional dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of multilinear algebra for reducing the order of multidimensional linear time-invariant (MLTI) systems. Our main tools are tensor rational Krylov subspace methods, which enable us to approximate the systems solution within a low-dimensional subspace. We introduce the tensor rational block Arnoldi and tensor rational block Lanczos algorithms. By utilizing these methods, we develop a model reduction approach based on projection techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate how these approaches can be applied to large-scale Lyapunov tensor equations, which are critical for the balanced truncation method, a well-known technique for order reduction. An adaptive method for choosing the interpolation points is also introduced. Finally, some numerical experiments are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive approaches.</description>

      <title>TimeMarker: A Versatile Video-LLM for Long and Short Video Understanding with Superior Temporal Localization Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal large language models (LMMs), particularly in vision-language tasks. However, existing video-language models often overlook precise temporal localization and struggle with videos of varying lengths. We introduce TimeMarker, a versatile Video-LLM designed for high-quality dialogue based on video content, emphasizing temporal localization. TimeMarker integrates Temporal Separator Tokens to enhance temporal awareness, accurately marking specific moments within videos. It employs the AnyLength mechanism for dynamic frame sampling and adaptive token merging, enabling effective handling of both short and long videos. Additionally, TimeMarker utilizes diverse datasets, including further transformed temporal-related video QA datasets, to bolster its temporal understanding capabilities. Image and interleaved data are also employed to further enhance the model's semantic perception ability. Evaluations demonstrate that TimeMarker achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, excelling in both short and long video categories.

      <title>SCoTT: Wireless-Aware Path Planning with Vision Language Models and Strategic Chains-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path planning is a complex problem for many practical applications, particularly in robotics. Existing algorithms, however, are exhaustive in nature and become increasingly complex when additional side constraints are incorporated alongside distance minimization. In this paper, a novel approach using vision language models (VLMs) is proposed for enabling path planning in complex wireless-aware environments. To this end, insights from a digital twin (DT) with real-world wireless ray tracing data are explored in order to guarantee an average path gain threshold while minimizing the trajectory length. First, traditional approaches such as A* are compared to several wireless-aware extensions, and an optimal iterative dynamic programming approach (DP-WA*) is derived, which fully takes into account all path gains and distance metrics within the DT. On the basis of these baselines, the role of VLMs as an alternative assistant for path planning is investigated, and a strategic chain-of-thought tasking (SCoTT) approach is proposed. SCoTT divides the complex planning task into several subproblems and solves each with advanced CoT prompting. Results show that SCoTT achieves very close average path gains compared to DP-WA* while at the same time yielding consistently shorter path lengths. The results also show that VLMs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by efficiently reducing the algorithm's search space and thus saving up to 62\% in execution time. This work underscores the potential of VLMs in future digital systems as capable assistants for solving complex tasks, while enhancing user interaction and accelerating rapid prototyping under diverse wireless constraints.</description>

      <title>The isotropic relaxed micromorphic model in polar coordinates and its application to an elastostatic axisymmetric extension problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the isotropic relaxed micromorphic model in polar coordinates and use this representation to solve explicitly an elastostatic axisymmetric extension problem involving a linear system of ordinary differential equations. To obtain an analytical solution, modified Bessel functions are utilized and closed-form solutions for the displacement and microdistortion are obtained. We show how certain limit cases (classical linear elasticity), which are naturally included in the relaxed micromorphic model, can be efficiently achieved. Furthermore, numerical results are calculated and the effects of various parameters are examined. The results can be used to calibrate and check corresponding finite element codes.</description>

      <title>Topological defects lead to energy transfer in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics are fluids in which the components have nematic symmetry and are driven out of equilibrium due to the microscopic generation of an active stress. When the active stress is high, it drives flows in the nematic and can lead to the proliferation of topological defects, a state we refer to as defect chaos. Using numerical simulations of active nematics, we observe energy transfer between length scales during defect chaos. We demonstrate that this energy transfer is driven by the exchange between variations in the orientation and degree of order in the nematic that predominantly occur during defect creation and annihilation. We then show that the primary features of energy transfer during defect chaos scale with the active length scale. Finally, we identify a second regime that features few defects, but rather bend walls. Similar to topological defects, these bend walls co-localize variations in the orientation with variations in the scalar order parameter leading to energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool giant secondary star.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving the Robustness of Security Attack Detectors Generated by LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development to generate functions, such as attack detectors, that implement security requirements. However, LLMs struggle to generate accurate code, resulting, e.g., in attack detectors that miss well-known attacks when used in practice. This is most likely due to the LLM lacking knowledge about some existing attacks and to the generated code being not evaluated in real usage scenarios. We propose a novel approach integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-Ranking into the LLM pipeline. RAG enhances the robustness of the output by incorporating external knowledge sources, while the Self-Ranking technique, inspired to the concept of Self-Consistency, generates multiple reasoning paths and creates ranks to select the most robust detector. Our extensive empirical study targets code generated by LLMs to detect two prevalent injection attacks in web security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi). Results show a significant improvement in detection performance compared to baselines, with an increase of up to 71%pt and 37%pt in the F2-Score for XSS and SQLi detection, respectively.</description>

      <title>How to Learn a New Language? An Efficient Solution for Self-Supervised Learning Models Unseen Languages Adaption in Low-Resource Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of speech Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models achieves impressive performance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, in low-resource language ASR, they encounter the domain mismatch problem between pre-trained and low-resource languages. Typical solutions like fine-tuning the SSL model suffer from high computation costs while using frozen SSL models as feature extractors comes with poor performance. To handle these issues, we extend a conventional efficient fine-tuning scheme based on the adapter. We add an extra intermediate adaptation to warm up the adapter and downstream model initialization. Remarkably, we update only 1-5% of the total model parameters to achieve the adaptation. Experimental results on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that our solution outperforms conventional efficient fine-tuning. It achieves up to a 28% relative improvement in the Character/Phoneme error rate when adapting to unseen languages.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the task to finding a substitution of the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>On analysis of open optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop analysis results for optimization algorithms that are open, that is, with inputs and outputs. Such algorithms arise for instance, when analyzing the effect of noise or disturbance on an algorithm, or when an algorithm is part of control loop without timescale separation. To be precise, we consider an incremental small gain problem to analyze robustness. Moreover, we investigate the behaviors of the closed loop between incrementally dissipative nonlinear plants and optimization algorithms. The framework we develop is built upon the theories of incremental dissipativity and monotone operators, and yields tests in the form of linear matrix inequalities.</description>

      <title>R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</description>

      <title>Indefinitely flat rotation curves from Mpc sized charged cocoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing exhibits that rotation curves of isolated galaxies remain flat up to Mpc scale (Mistele et al, 2024). Recently we proposed that dark matter is a combination of electrostatic and vacuum energy in standard physics. In this theory, isolated galaxies may be embedded in ``charged cocoons'', spheres with $\pm 1/r^2$ charge density. The related circular rotation curves decay at the Mpc scale. The analytic solution is extended to the early Universe. A peak in the cosmic microwave background spectrum is expected at the arcsec scale. The induced nanometer size of the cocoons at the Big Bang makes the initial state inhomogeneous.</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Objective Perceptual Audio Quality Assessment -- Part 1: A Novel Data-Driven Cognitive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient audio quality assessment is vital for streamlining audio codec development. Objective assessment tools have been developed over time to algorithmically predict quality ratings from subjective assessments, the gold standard for quality judgment. Many of these tools use perceptual auditory models to extract audio features that are mapped to a basic audio quality score prediction using machine learning algorithms and subjective scores as training data. However, existing tools struggle with generalization in quality prediction, especially when faced with unknown signal and distortion types. This is particularly evident in the presence of signals coded using non-waveform-preserving parametric techniques. Addressing these challenges, this two-part work proposes extensions to the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ - ITU-R BS.1387-1) recommendation. Part 1 focuses on increasing generalization, while Part 2 targets accurate spatial audio quality measurement in audio coding.
  To enhance prediction generalization, this paper (Part 1) introduces a novel machine learning approach that uses subjective data to model cognitive aspects of audio quality perception. The proposed method models the perceived severity of audible distortions by adaptively weighting different distortion metrics. The weights are determined using an interaction cost function that captures relationships between distortion salience and cognitive effects. Compared to other machine learning methods and established tools, the proposed architecture achieves higher prediction accuracy on large databases of previously unseen subjective quality scores. The perceptually-motivated model offers a more manageable alternative to general-purpose machine learning algorithms, allowing potential extensions and improvements to multi-dimensional quality measurement without complete retraining.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions of a drift-diffusion system for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel uniqueness result for an instationary drift-diffusion model for perovskite solar cells. This model for vacancy-assisted charge transport uses Fermi--Dirac statistics for electrons and holes and Blakemore statistics for the mobile ionic vacancies in the perovskite. Existence of weak solutions and their boundedness was proven in a previous work. For the uniqueness proof, we establish improved integrability of the gradients of the charge-carrier densities. Based on estimates obtained in the previous paper, we consider suitably regularized continuity equations with partly frozen arguments and apply the regularity results for scalar quasilinear elliptic equations by Meinlschmidt &amp; Rehberg, Evolution Equations and Control Theory, 2016, 5(1):147-184.</description>

      <title>KANs for Computer Vision: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) applied to computer vision tasks, particularly image classification. KANs introduce learnable activation functions on edges, offering flexible non-linear transformations compared to traditional pre-fixed activation functions with specific neural work like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While KANs have shown promise mostly in simplified or small-scale datasets, their effectiveness for more complex real-world tasks such as computer vision tasks remains less explored. To fill this gap, this experimental study aims to provide extended observations and insights into the strengths and limitations of KANs. We reveal that although KANs can perform well in specific vision tasks, they face significant challenges, including increased hyperparameter sensitivity and higher computational costs. These limitations suggest that KANs require architectural adaptations, such as integration with other architectures, to be practical for large-scale vision problems. This study focuses on empirical findings rather than proposing new methods, aiming to inform future research on optimizing KANs, in particular computer vision applications or alike.</description>

      <title>PATHS: A Hierarchical Transformer for Efficient Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.</description>

      <title>Observation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like states at the edge of CrBr3/NbSe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures have attracted extensive attention as they potentially host topological superconductivity. Relevant experimental signatures have recently been reported in CrBr3/NbSe2 ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructure, but controversies remain. Here, we reinvestigate CrBr3/NbSe2 by an ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscope with higher spatial and energy resolutions. We find that the single-layer CrBr3 film is insulating and acts likely as a vacuum barrier, the measured superconducting gap and vortex state on it are nearly the same as those of NbSe2 substrate. Meanwhile, in-gap features are observed at the edges of CrBr3 island, which display either a zero-energy conductance peak or a pair of particle-hole symmetric bound states. They are discretely distributed at the edges of CrBr3 film, and their appearance is found closely related to the atomic lattice reconstruction near the edges. By increasing tunneling transmissivity, the zero-energy conductance peak quickly splits, while the pair of nonzero in-gap bound states first approach each other, merge, and then split again. These behaviors are unexpected for Majorana edge modes, but in consistent with the conventional Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. Our results provide critical information for further understanding the interfacial coupling in CrBr3/NbSe2 heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Highly-stable, eco-friendly and selective Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite-based ozone sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as potential gas sensing elements due to their unique ability to detect and respond to an external stimulus with measurable electrical or optical signals. The distinctive characteristics of these materials lie in their ability to operate upon gas exposure at room temperature. However, the presence of lead (Pb) poses a serious challenge for their widespread application and commercialization, owing to its toxicity. To address this issue, lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite is explored as a promising alternative sensing element for room temperature gas detection. This sensor can be regarded as eco-friendly for the following reasons: it does not contain Pb; it is synthesized at room temperature without using strong organic solvents; and it operates and recovers at room temperature without heating or UV irradiation and with a very low input voltage (0.1V), thus reducing overall energy consumption. The influence of the perovskite morphology on the ozone (O3) sensing performance is investigated, as well as the sensing stability under varying conditions of time, humidity, and temperature. Notably, the sensors' exceptional selectivity for O3 over other gases and the interaction between the gases and the perovskite surface is confirmed through experimental and first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>SharpDepth: Sharpening Metric Depth Predictions Using Diffusion Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SharpDepth, a novel approach to monocular metric depth estimation that combines the metric accuracy of discriminative depth estimation methods (e.g., Metric3D, UniDepth) with the fine-grained boundary sharpness typically achieved by generative methods (e.g., Marigold, Lotus). Traditional discriminative models trained on real-world data with sparse ground-truth depth can accurately predict metric depth but often produce over-smoothed or low-detail depth maps. Generative models, in contrast, are trained on synthetic data with dense ground truth, generating depth maps with sharp boundaries yet only providing relative depth with low accuracy. Our approach bridges these limitations by integrating metric accuracy with detailed boundary preservation, resulting in depth predictions that are both metrically precise and visually sharp. Our extensive zero-shot evaluations on standard depth estimation benchmarks confirm SharpDepth effectiveness, showing its ability to achieve both high depth accuracy and detailed representation, making it well-suited for applications requiring high-quality depth perception across diverse, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Dependency-Aware CAV Task Scheduling via Diffusion-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dependency-aware task scheduling strategy for dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Specifically, different computation tasks of CAVs consisting of multiple dependency subtasks are judiciously assigned to nearby CAVs or the base station for promptly completing tasks. Therefore, we formulate a joint scheduling priority and subtask assignment optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the average task completion time. The problem aims at improving the long-term system performance, which is reformulated as a Markov decision process. To solve the problem, we further propose a diffusion-based reinforcement learning algorithm, named Synthetic DDQN based Subtasks Scheduling, which can make adaptive task scheduling decision in real time. A diffusion model-based synthetic experience replay is integrated into the reinforcement learning framework, which can generate sufficient synthetic data in experience replay buffer, thereby significantly accelerating convergence and improving sample efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on reducing task completion time, comparing to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based classification for Single Photon Space Debris Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of man-made debris in Earth's orbit poses a threat to active satellite missions due to the risk of collision. Characterizing unknown debris is, therefore, of high interest. Light Curves (LCs) are temporal variations of object brightness and have been shown to contain information such as shape, attitude, and rotational state. Since 2015, the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) group of Space Research Institute (IWF) Graz has been building a space debris LC catalogue. The LCs are captured on a Single Photon basis, which sets them apart from CCD-based measurements. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have emerged as a viable technique for analyzing LCs. This work aims to classify Single Photon Space Debris using the ML framework. We have explored LC classification using k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Random Forest (RDF), XGBoost (XGB), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers in order to assess the difference in performance between traditional and deep models. Instead of performing classification on the direct LCs data, we extracted features from the data first using an automated pipeline. We apply our models on three tasks, which are classifying individual objects, objects grouped into families according to origin (e.g., GLONASS satellites), and grouping into general types (e.g., rocket bodies). We successfully classified Space Debris LCs captured on Single Photon basis, obtaining accuracies as high as 90.7%. Further, our experiments show that the classifiers provide better classification accuracy with automated extracted features than other methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Stokes origami: folds, cusps and skyrmionic facets in random polarisation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the jacobian of a random transverse polarisation field, from the transverse plane to the Poincar\'e sphere, as a Skyrme density partially covering the sphere. Connected domains of the plane where the jacobian has the same sign -- patches -- map to facets subtending some general solid angle on the Poincar\'e sphere. As a generic continuous mapping between surfaces, we interpret the polarisation pattern on the sphere in terms of fold lines (corresponding to the crease lines between neighbouring patches) and cusp points (where fold lines meet). We perform a basic statistical analysis of the properties of the patches and facets, including a brief discussion of the percolation properties of the jacobian domains. Connections with abstract origami manifolds are briefly considered. This analysis combines previous studies of structured skyrmionic polarisation patterns with random polarisation patterns, suggesting a particle-like interpretation of random patches as polarisation skyrmionic anyons.</description>

Abstract: Context. Since the mechanism of energy release from solar flares is still not fully understood, the study of fine-scale features developing during flares becomes important for progressing towards a consistent picture of the essential physical mechanisms. Aims. We aim to probe the fine structures in flare ribbons at the chromospheric level using high-resolution observations with imaging and spectral techniques. Methods. We present a GOES C2.4 class solar flare observed with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The high-resolution SST observations offer spectroscopic data in the H-alpha, Ca II 8542 {\AA}, and H-beta lines, which we use to analyse the flare ribbon. Results. Within the eastern flare ribbon, chromospheric bright blobs were detected and analysed in Ca II 8542 {\AA}, H-alpha, and H-beta wavelengths. A comparison of blobs in H-beta observations and Si IV 1400 {\AA} has also been performed. These blobs are observed as almost circular structures having widths from 140 km-200 km. The intensity profiles of the blobs show a red wing asymmetry. Conclusions. From the high spatial and temporal resolution H-beta observations, we conclude that the periodicity of the blobs in the flare ribbon, which are near-equally spaced in the range 330-550 km, is likely due to fragmented reconnection processes within a flare current sheet. This supports the theory of a direct link between fine-structure flare ribbons and current sheet tearing. We believe our observations represent the highest resolution evidence of fine-structure flare ribbons to date.</description>

      <title>Randomized-Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning in Decision Tree Model to Improve Performance of Cardiovascular Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease refers to any critical condition that impacts the heart. Because heart diseases can be life-threatening. Researchers are focusing on designing smart systems to accurately diagnose them based on electronic health data, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Heart disease classification using machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Na\"ive Bayes(NB), Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) are often hindered by overfitting. These ML algorithms need extensive hyperparameter tuning. Random Search offers a faster, and, more efficient exploration of hyperparameter space, but, it may overlook optimal regions. Grid Search, though exhaustive, but, it is computationally expensive and inefficient, particularly with high-dimensional data. To address these limitations, Randomized-Grid Search, a novel hybrid optimization method is proposed that combines the global exploration strengths of Random Search with the focused, and, exhaustive search of Grid Search in the most promising regions. This hybrid approach efficiently balances exploration and exploitation. The proposed model optimizes the hyperparameter for Decision Tree model. The proposed model is applied to UCI heart disease dataset for classification. It enhances model performance, provides improved accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Randomized-Grid Search outperforms traditional methods by significant margins. The proposed model provides a more effective solution for machine learning applications in healthcare diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound: A Case Study on Lyapunov-stable Neural Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning Lyapunov-stable neural controllers which provably satisfy the Lyapunov asymptotic stability condition within a region-of-attraction. Compared to previous works which commonly used counterexample guided training on this task, we develop a new and generally formulated certified training framework named CT-BaB, and we optimize for differentiable verified bounds, to produce verification-friendly models. In order to handle the relatively large region-of-interest, we propose a novel framework of training-time branch-and-bound to dynamically maintain a training dataset of subregions throughout training, such that the hardest subregions are iteratively split into smaller ones whose verified bounds can be computed more tightly to ease the training. We demonstrate that our new training framework can produce models which can be more efficiently verified at test time. On the largest 2D quadrotor dynamical system, verification for our model is more than 5X faster compared to the baseline, while our size of region-of-attraction is 16X larger than the baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a stationary sequence of random variables we derive a self-normalized functional limit theorem under joint regular variation with index $\alpha \in (0,2)$ and weak dependence conditions. The convergence takes place in the space of real-valued cadlag functions on $[0,1]$ with the Skorokhod $M_{1}$ topology.</description>

      <title>Taste-splittings of staggered, Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz fermions under gradient flow in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz fermions show a near-degeneracy of the $2$ species involved, similar to the $2^{d/2}$ species of staggered fermions. Hence in $d=2$ dimensions all three formulations happen to be minimally doubled (two species). This near-degeneracy shows up both in the eigenvalue spectrum of the respective Dirac operator and in spectroscopic quantities (e.g. the pion mass), but in the former case it is easier to quantify. We use the quenched Schwinger model to determine the low-lying eigenvalues of these fermion operators at a fixed gradient flow time $\tau$ (either in lattice units or in physical units, hence keeping either $\tau/a^2$ or $e^2 \tau$ fixed at all $\beta$).</description>

      <title>A gentle invitation to the fractional world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book is intended as a self-contained introduction to selected topics in the fractional world, focusing particularly on aspects that arise in the study of equations driven by the fractional Laplacian.
  The scope of this work is not intended to be exhaustive or all-encompassing. We have chosen topics that we believe will appeal to readers embarking on their journey into fractional analysis. It requires only fundamental calculus and a basic understanding of measure theory.
  In Chapter 1, we introduce the primary object of study, the fractional Laplacian. This operator appears in diverse contexts, prompting multiple definitions and viewpoints, many of which we explore, along with some key identities.
  A notable distinction between local and nonlocal analysis is that in the latter, explicit calculations are often impractical or impossible. There are anyway some fortunate exceptions which are gathered in Chapter 2, providing useful and instructive examples.
  Chapter 3 presents an introduction to the important aspect of Liouville-type results.
  A large portion of this book is devoted to the regularity theory of solutions in Lebesgue spaces. Chapter 4 examines global solutions using Riesz and Bessel potential analysis, capturing the impact of both low and high frequencies on smoothness, decay, and oscillations. These spaces are also flexible enough to provide, as a byproduct, a solid regularity theory in the more commonly used fractional Sobolev spaces.
  In Chapter 5 we derive the corresponding interior regularity theory for solutions within a bounded domain using appropriate cutoffs and localization techniques.
  Additionally, technical appendices include auxiliary results used in key proofs.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm as a tool for detection setup optimisation: SiFi-CC case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Proton therapy is a precision-focused cancer treatment where accurate proton beam range monitoring is critical to ensure effective dose delivery. This can be achieved by prompt gamma detection with a Compton camera like the SiFi-CC. This study aims to show the feasibility of optimising the geometry of SiFi-CC Compton camera for verification of dose distribution via prompt gamma detection using a genetic algorithm (GA). Approach: The SiFi-CC key geometric parameters for optimisation with the GA are the source-to-scatterer and scatterer-to-absorber distances, and the module thicknesses. The optimisation process was conducted with a software framework based on the Geant4 toolkit, which included detailed and realistic modelling of gamma interactions, detector response, and further steps such as event selection and image reconstruction. The performance of each individual configuration was evaluated using a fitness function incorporating factors related to gamma detection efficiency and image resolution. Results: The GA-optimised SiFi-CC configuration demonstrated the capability to detect a 5 mm proton beam range shift with a 2 mm resolution using 5e8 protons. The best-performing geometry, with 16 fibre layers in the scatterer, 36 layers in the absorber, source-to-scatterer distance 150 mm and scatterer-to-absorber distance 120 mm, has an imaging sensitivity of 5.58(1)e-5. Significance: This study demonstrates that the SiFi-CC setup, optimised through a GA, can reliably detect clinically relevant proton beam range shifts, improving real-time range verification accuracy in proton therapy. The presented implementation of a GA is a systematic and feasible way of searching for a SiFi-CC geometry that shows the best performance.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as intelligent computing technique for solving partial differential equations: Limitation and Future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a representative method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. PINNs provide a novel approach to solving PDEs through optimization algorithms, offering a unified framework for solving both forward and inverse problems. However, some limitations in terms of solution accuracy and generality have also been revealed. This paper systematically summarizes the limitations of PINNs and identifies three root causes for their failure in solving PDEs: (1) Poor multiscale approximation ability and ill-conditioning caused by PDE losses; (2) Insufficient exploration of convergence and error analysis, resulting in weak mathematical rigor; (3) Inadequate integration of physical information, causing mismatch between residuals and iteration errors. By focusing on addressing these limitations in PINNs, we outline the future directions and prospects for the intelligent computing of PDEs: (1) Analysis of ill-conditioning in PINNs and mitigation strategies; (2) Improvements to PINNs by enforcing temporal causality; (3) Empowering PINNs with classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Exploration of LLM Multi-Agent Application Implementation Based on LangGraph+CrewAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large model technology, the application of agent technology in various fields is becoming increasingly widespread, profoundly changing people's work and lifestyles. In complex and dynamic systems, multi-agents achieve complex tasks that are difficult for a single agent to complete through division of labor and collaboration among agents. This paper discusses the integrated application of LangGraph and CrewAI. LangGraph improves the efficiency of information transmission through graph architecture, while CrewAI enhances team collaboration capabilities and system performance through intelligent task allocation and resource management. The main research contents of this paper are: (1) designing the architecture of agents based on LangGraph for precise control; (2) enhancing the capabilities of agents based on CrewAI to complete a variety of tasks. This study aims to delve into the application of LangGraph and CrewAI in multi-agent systems, providing new perspectives for the future development of agent technology, and promoting technological progress and application innovation in the field of large model intelligent agents.</description>

      <title>Thai Financial Domain Adaptation of THaLLE -- Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific challenges, such as specialized terminology and localized regulations. Existing financial LLMs, like FinGPT and BloombergGPT, lack support for the Thai financial domain. We developed a Thai Financial LLM using the Investment Consultant (IC) exam dataset from the Stock Exchange of Thailand. To address dataset limitations, we applied data augmentation, ReLoRA for efficient training, Continued Pretraining (CPT) for domain knowledge, and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA) for fine-tuning. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) simulated exam scenarios, while Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) refined the model using feedback. The model achieved scores of 72%, 72%, and 84% on IC exam levels P1, P2, and P3, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in Thai financial advisory tasks and its potential for specialized applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a timing study of the gamma and X-ray observations and analysis of a sample of bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; i.e. GRB 180720B, GRB 181222B, GRB 211211A and GRB 220910A), including the very bright and long GRB 211211A (a.k.a. kilonova candidate). They have been detected and observed by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board the Fermi mission. The early (T-T0=s) and high-energy (0.3-20 MeV) ASIM High Energy Detector (HED) and (150 keV-30 GeV) Fermi (BGO) light curves show well-defined peaks with a low quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency between 2.5-3.5 Hz that could be identified with the spin of the neutron star in the binary mergers (coinciding with the orbital frequency of the binary merger) originating these GRBs. These QPOs consist on the first detection of low-frequency QPOs (&lt;10 Hz) detected in magnetars so far. We also detect a strong QPO at 21.8-22 Hz in GRB 181222B together with its (less significant) harmonics. The low-frequency QPO would correspond to the signal of the orbiting neutron star (NS) previous to the final coalescence giving rise to the gravitational-wave (GW) signal.</description>

      <title>On the distance spectral radius bounds and improved bounds on the spectral radius of power graphs of some finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the group G and construct its power graph, whose vertex set consists of the elements of G. Two distinct vertices (elements) are adjacent in the graph if and only if one element can be expressed as an integral power of the other. In the paper (Indagationes Mathematicae 29(2) (2018), pp 730 t0 737), Chattopadhyay et al. gave spectral radius bounds of the power graph of certain finite groups. In this article, we improved the bounds of the spectral radius of the power graphs of the above results. Furthermore, we provide bounds for the distance spectral radius of the power graph of the cyclic group Cn, the dihedral group D2n, and the dicyclic group Q4n. For some cases, we find the bounds are exact if and only if they pertain to a particular family of graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid induced by U(1) gauge field interactions: a functional renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-Fermi-liquid state formed by an isotropic, degenerate Fermi gas in two spatial dimensions interacting with a U(1) gauge field. Our calculation uses the functional renormalization group (fRG) with a soft frequency cutoff for the fermions. The fRG scheme we employ takes account of the gauge symmetry, which imposes relations (modified Ward-Takahashi identities) between the couplings which constrain the RG flow. The critical exponents and couplings we find for the resulting non-Fermi liquid are mostly insensitive to whether or not we enforce the gauge symmetry constraints, which signifies either that the constraints are superfluous or that the frequency-cutoff scheme is particularly robust. The exception is the gauge-boson mass term, which is RG-relevant about the fixed point without the constraints, but is irrelevant when they are enforced. The latter is physically accurate, as a gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. In addition, we find $z=2$ and $\Sigma(\omega,k_F)\sim\omega^{1/2}$ for the boson dynamical exponent and scaling of the fermion self-energy, respectively. These results differ considerably from those of past works on the model, though we argue for their plausibility.</description>

      <title>GeV ALP from TeV Vector-like leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model where a GeV axion-like-particle (ALP) is predicted in a large portion of the parameter space due to the presence of explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking terms in an exotic leptonic sector. The latter provides a solution to the muon $g-2$ anomaly, within the framework of the Linear Seesaw neutrino mechanism. The spectrum is extended by a complex scalar singlet only transforming under the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which generates the ALP. Its couplings with fermions can continuously span over many orders of magnitude, which constitutes a specific feature of this model in contrast to generic ultraviolet constructions. Interestingly, these couplings are suppressed by the ALP characteristic scale that can be as low as the TeV scale, which represents a novel feature of the model and opens up to several phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>A gentle push funziona benissimo: making instructed models in Italian via contrastive activation steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting models to a language that was only partially present in the pre-training data requires fine-tuning, which is expensive in terms of both data and computational resources. As an alternative to fine-tuning, we explore the potential of activation steering-based techniques to enhance model performance on Italian tasks. Through our experiments we show that Italian steering (i) can be successfully applied to different models, (ii) achieves performances comparable to, or even better than, fine-tuned models for Italian, and (iii) yields higher quality and consistency in Italian generations. We also discuss the utility of steering and fine-tuning in the contemporary LLM landscape where models are anyway getting high Italian performances even if not explicitly trained in this language.</description>

      <title>On the possible existence of a $S=-3, \, I=1$ pentaquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the possible existence of a strangeness $S=-3$, isospin $I=1$ pentaquark state $P_{sss}$ generated dynamically from the $\bar{K}\Xi$ interaction. We employ a unitarized scheme in coupled channels based on the chiral Lagrangian expanded up to next-to-leading order (NLO), and show that the inclusion of the NLO terms is crucial to provide the necessary attraction that favors the existence of such triply strange pentaquark. The $\bar{K}\Xi$ femtoscopic correlation functions are calculated as example of a possible experimental measurement in which a direct signal of the $P_{sss}$ state could be observed.</description>

      <title>Deep End-to-end Adaptive k-Space Sampling, Reconstruction, and Registration for Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic MRI enables a range of clinical applications, including cardiac function assessment, organ motion tracking, and radiotherapy guidance. However, fully sampling the dynamic k-space data is often infeasible due to time constraints and physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion. This necessitates undersampling, which degrades the quality of reconstructed images. Poor image quality not only hinders visualization but also impairs the estimation of deformation fields, crucial for registering dynamic (moving) images to a static reference image. This registration enables tasks such as motion correction, treatment planning, and quantitative analysis in applications like cardiac imaging and MR-guided radiotherapy. To overcome the challenges posed by undersampling and motion, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework that integrates adaptive dynamic k-space sampling, reconstruction, and registration. Our approach begins with a DL-based adaptive sampling strategy, optimizing dynamic k-space acquisition to capture the most relevant data for each specific case. This is followed by a DL-based reconstruction module that produces images optimized for accurate deformation field estimation from the undersampled moving data. Finally, a registration module estimates the deformation fields aligning the reconstructed dynamic images with a static reference. The proposed framework is independent of specific reconstruction and registration modules allowing for plug-and-play integration of these components. The entire framework is jointly trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised loss functions, enabling end-to-end optimization for improved performance across all components. Through controlled experiments and ablation studies, we validate each component, demonstrating that each choice contributes to robust motion estimation from undersampled dynamic data.</description>

      <title>IKUN: Initialization to Keep snn training and generalization great with sUrrogate-stable variaNce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight initialization significantly impacts the convergence and performance of neural networks. While traditional methods like Xavier and Kaiming initialization are widely used, they often fall short for spiking neural networks (SNNs), which have distinct requirements compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs).
  To address this, we introduce \textbf{IKUN}, a variance-stabilizing initialization method integrated with surrogate gradient functions, specifically designed for SNNs. \textbf{IKUN} stabilizes signal propagation, accelerates convergence, and enhances generalization. Experiments show \textbf{IKUN} improves training efficiency by up to \textbf{50\%}, achieving \textbf{95\%} training accuracy and \textbf{91\%} generalization accuracy.
  Hessian analysis reveals that \textbf{IKUN}-trained models converge to flatter minima, characterized by Hessian eigenvalues near zero on the positive side, promoting better generalization. The method is open-sourced for further exploration: \href{https://github.com/MaeChd/SurrogateVarStabe}{https://github.com/MaeChd/SurrogateVarStabe}.</description>

      <title>Test RG Running of the Leptonic Dirac CP Phase with Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the possibility of using the near detector at reactor neutrino experiments to probe the renormalization group (RG) running effect on the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_D$. Although the reactor neutrino oscillation cannot directly measure $\delta_D$, it can probe the deviation $\Delta \delta \equiv \delta_D(Q^2_d) - \delta_D(Q^2_p)$ caused by the RG running. Being a key element, the mismatched momentum transfers at neutrino production ($Q^2_p$) and detection ($Q^2_d$) processes can differ by two orders. We illustrate this concept with the upcoming JUNO-TAO experiment and obtain the projected sensitivity to the CP RG running beta function $\beta_\delta$.</description>

      <title>Target Tracking: Statistics of Successive Successful Target Detection in Automotive Radar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric for stochastic geometry based analysis of automotive radar networks called target {\it tracking probability}. Unlike the well-investigated detection probability (often termed as the success or coverage probability in stochastic geometry), the tracking probability characterizes the event of successive successful target detection with a sequence of radar pulses. From a theoretical standpoint, this work adds to the rich repertoire of statistical metrics in stochastic geometry-based wireless network analysis. To optimize the target tracking probability in high interference scenarios, we study a block medium access control (MAC) protocol for the automotive radars to share a common channel and recommend the optimal MAC parameter for a given vehicle and street density. Importantly, we show that the optimal MAC parameter that maximizes the detection probability may not be the one that maximizes the tracking probability. Our research reveals how the tracking event can be naturally mapped to the quality of service (QoS) requirements of latency and reliability for different vehicular technology use-cases. This can enable use-case specific adaptive selection of radar parameters for optimal target tracking.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Integration of Longitudinal Noninvasive Diagnostics for Survival Prediction in Immunotherapy Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Analyzing noninvasive longitudinal and multimodal data using artificial intelligence could potentially transform immunotherapy for cancer patients, paving the way towards precision medicine. Methods: In this study, we integrated pre- and on-treatment blood measurements, prescribed medications and CT-based volumes of organs from a large pan-cancer cohort of 694 patients treated with immunotherapy to predict short and long-term overall survival. By leveraging a combination of recent developments, different variants of our extended multimodal transformer-based simple temporal attention (MMTSimTA) network were trained end-to-end to predict mortality at three, six, nine and twelve months. These models were also compared to baseline methods incorporating intermediate and late fusion based integration methods. Results: The strongest prognostic performance was demonstrated using the extended transformer-based multimodal model with area under the curves (AUCs) of $0.84 \pm $0.04, $0.83 \pm $0.02, $0.82 \pm $0.02, $0.81 \pm $0.03 for 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month survival prediction, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that analyzing integrated early treatment data has potential for predicting survival of immunotherapy patients. Integrating complementary noninvasive modalities into a jointly trained model, using our extended transformer-based architecture, demonstrated an improved multimodal prognostic performance, especially in short term survival prediction.</description>

      <title>Active partitioning: inverting the paradigm of active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets often incorporate various functional patterns related to different aspects or regimes, which are typically not equally present throughout the dataset. We propose a novel, general-purpose partitioning algorithm that utilizes competition between models to detect and separate these functional patterns. This competition is induced by multiple models iteratively submitting their predictions for the dataset, with the best prediction for each data point being rewarded with training on that data point. This reward mechanism amplifies each model's strengths and encourages specialization in different patterns. The specializations can then be translated into a partitioning scheme. The amplification of each model's strengths inverts the active learning paradigm: while active learning typically focuses the training of models on their weaknesses to minimize the number of required training data points, our concept reinforces the strengths of each model, thus specializing them. We validate our concept -- called active partitioning -- with various datasets with clearly distinct functional patterns, such as mechanical stress and strain data in a porous structure. The active partitioning algorithm produces valuable insights into the datasets' structure, which can serve various further applications. As a demonstration of one exemplary usage, we set up modular models consisting of multiple expert models, each learning a single partition, and compare their performance on more than twenty popular regression problems with single models learning all partitions simultaneously. Our results show significant improvements, with up to 54% loss reduction, confirming our partitioning algorithm's utility.</description>

      <title>Perturbative black-hole and horizon solutions in gravity with explicit spacetime-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present static and spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the mass-dimension $d\leq 4$ action of an effective-field theory, choosing the diffeomorphism symmetry to be broken explicitly. By using the reduced-action method with a Schwarzschild seed-solution, we find static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions to the field equations to linear order in the symmetry-breaking coefficients, which are consistent solutions to the modified Einstein equations at the same order. Using several ans\"atze for the symmetry-breaking coefficient we classify the allowed solutions, and we compute standard consequences and observables, including horizons, thermodynamics, photon geodesics, and perihelion precession. We find that the horizon structure of some of our solutions are similar to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, and that several of them exhibit physical singularities at $r=2M$. We note in particular that introducing more than one non-zero coefficient for spacetime-symmetry breaking coefficient leads to a solution with three horizons; the aim is to obtain observables that can be confronted to black holes observational data.</description>

      <title>RPST-Inspired Formalism for Black Holes in Flat Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel formalism for the thermodynamics of flat black holes, inspired by the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) framework. Our construction is motivated by the observed similarities in the thermodynamic behavior of flat black holes within the R\'enyi entropy framework and that of AdS black holes described by the Bekenstein entropy regime. The RPST framework is, by construction, exclusive to AdS black holes because it depends on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which is linked to the central charge $C$ of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). However, for non-AdS black holes, where $\Lambda$ is absent, we introduce a deformation parameter $\lambda$ to replace the central charge $C$. This RPST-inspired formalism incorporates $\lambda$ and its conjugate variable, the response potential $\zeta$, as a new pair of thermodynamic variables, analogous to the central charge $C$ and chemical potential $\mu$ in the AdS case. To illustrate the applicability of this formalism, we analyze two examples: the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) flat black hole and the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic hadrons beyond the conventional quark model have been discovered in the past two decades. Investigations of these states can lead to deep understanding of nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interaction. In this concise review, we focus on the productions of exotic hadrons in $pp$, $p\bar p$, and nuclear collisions. Experimental observations of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as prototypes of hadronic molecules, in heavy ion collisions will also be briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Flux Transport in Advection Dominated Accretion Flow Towards the Formation of Magnetically Arrested Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetically arrested disks (MADs) have attracted much attention in recent years. The formation of MADs are usually attributed to the accumulation of a sufficient amount of dynamically significant poloidal magnetic flux. In this work, the magnetic flux transport within an advection dominated accretion flow and the formation of a MAD are investigated. The structure and dynamics of an inner MAD connected with an outer ADAF are derived by solving a set of differential equations with suitable boundary conditions. We find that an inner MAD disk is eventually formed at a region about several ten Schwarzschild radius outside the horizon. Due to the presence of strong large-scale magnetic field, the radial velocity of the accretion flow is significantly decreased. The angular velocity of the MAD region is highly subkeplerian with $\Omega \sim (0.4-0.5)\Omega_{\rm K}$ and the corresponding ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is about $\beta \lesssim 1$. Also, we find that MAD is unlikely to be formed through the inward flux advection process when the external magnetic field strength weak enough with $\beta_{\rm out}\gtrsim 100$ around $R_{\rm out}\sim 1000R_{\rm s}$. Based on the rough estimate, we find that the jet power of a black hole, with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ and spin $a_*$, surrounded by an ADAF with inner MAD region is about two order of magnitude larger than that of a black hole surrounded by a normal ADAF. This may account for the powerful jets observed in some Fanaroff Riley type I galaxies with a very low Eddington ratio.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Deep Learning-based Prediction of Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning promises to accelerate the material discovery by enabling high-throughput prediction of desirable macro-properties from atomic-level descriptors or structures. However, the limited data available about precise values of these properties have been a barrier, leading to predictive models with limited precision or the ability to generalize. This is particularly true of lattice thermal conductivity (LTC): existing datasets of precise (ab initio, DFT-based) computed values are limited to a few dozen materials with little variability. Based on such datasets, we study the impact of transfer learning on both the precision and generalizability of a deep learning model (ParAIsite). We start from an existing model (MEGNet~\cite{Chen2019}) and show that improvements are obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained version on different tasks. Interestingly, we also show that a much greater improvement is obtained when first fine-tuning it on a large datasets of low-quality approximations of LTC (based on the AGL model) and then applying a second phase of fine-tuning with our high-quality, smaller-scale datasets. The promising results obtained pave the way not only towards a greater ability to explore large databases in search of low thermal conductivity materials but also to methods enabling increasingly precise predictions in areas where quality data are rare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metaphor studies community has developed numerous valuable labelled corpora in various languages over the years. Many of these resources are not only unknown to the NLP community, but are also often not easily shared among the researchers. Both in human sciences and in NLP, researchers could benefit from a centralised database of labelled resources, easily accessible and unified under an identical format. To facilitate this, we present MetaphorShare, a website to integrate metaphor datasets making them open and accessible. With this effort, our aim is to encourage researchers to share and upload more datasets in any language in order to facilitate metaphor studies and the development of future metaphor processing NLP systems. The website is accessible at www.metaphorshare.com.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Retail Pricing via Q-Learning -- A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Enhanced Revenue Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of a reinforcement learning (RL) framework using the Q-Learning algorithm to enhance dynamic pricing strategies in the retail sector. Unlike traditional pricing methods, which often rely on static demand models, our RL approach continuously adapts to evolving market dynamics, offering a more flexible and responsive pricing strategy. By creating a simulated retail environment, we demonstrate how RL effectively addresses real-time changes in consumer behavior and market conditions, leading to improved revenue outcomes. Our results illustrate that the RL model not only surpasses traditional methods in terms of revenue generation but also provides insights into the complex interplay of price elasticity and consumer demand. This research underlines the significant potential of applying artificial intelligence in economic decision-making, paving the way for more sophisticated, data-driven pricing models in various commercial domains.</description>

      <title>Break the ID-Language Barrier: An Adaption Framework for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked exploration in recommendation systems, however, their limited domain-specific knowledge remains a critical bottleneck. Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>TSD-SR: One-Step Diffusion with Target Score Distillation for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly applied to real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) task. Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs and homogeneous Lotka-Volterra systems with linear Darboux polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate homogeneous $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems which admit $k$ additional linear Darboux polynomials, with admissible hypergraphs of order $n$ and size $k$. We study the equivalence relation on admissible hypergraphs induced by linear transformations of the associated LV-systems, for $n\leq 5$. We present a new 13-parameter 5-component superintegrable Lotka-Volterra system, i.e. one that is not equivalent to a so-called tree-system. We conjecture that tree-systems associated with nonisomorphic trees are not equivalent, which we verified for $n&lt;9$.</description>

      <title>"What you think is private is no longer" -- Investigating the Aftermath of Shoulder Surfing on Smartphones in Everyday Life through the Eyes of the Victims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shoulder surfing has been studied extensively, however, it remains unexplored whether and how it impacts users. Understanding this is important as it determines whether shoulder surfing poses a significant concern and, if so, how best to address it. By surveying smartphone users in the UK, we explore how shoulder surfing impacts a) the privacy perceptions of victim users and b) their interaction with smartphones. We found that the impact of being shoulder surfed is highly individual. It is perceived as unavoidable and frequently occurring, leading to increased time for task completion. Individuals are concerned for their own and other peoples privacy, seeing shoulder surfing as a gateway to more serious threats like identity or device theft. Participants expressed a willingness to alter their behaviour and use software based protective measures to prevent shoulder surfing, yet, this comes with a set of user defined criteria, such as effectiveness, affordability, reliability, and availability. We discuss future work directions for user-centred shoulder surfing mitigation.</description>

      <title>Wearable intelligent throat enables natural speech in stroke patients with dysarthria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multi-view Multi-label Classification via a Dual-level Contrastive Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multi-view and multi-label classification have become significant domains for comprehensive data analysis and exploration. However, incompleteness both in views and labels is still a real-world scenario for multi-view multi-label classification. In this paper, we seek to focus on double missing multi-view multi-label classification tasks and propose our dual-level contrastive learning framework to solve this issue. Different from the existing works, which couple consistent information and view-specific information in the same feature space, we decouple the two heterogeneous properties into different spaces and employ contrastive learning theory to fully disentangle the two properties. Specifically, our method first introduces a two-channel decoupling module that contains a shared representation and a view-proprietary representation to effectively extract consistency and complementarity information across all views. Second, to efficiently filter out high-quality consistent information from multi-view representations, two consistency objectives based on contrastive learning are conducted on the high-level features and the semantic labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has more stable and superior classification performance.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of bosonic Gaussian thermal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <title>Hidden Data Privacy Breaches in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm for conducting machine learning across broad and decentralized datasets, promising enhanced privacy by obviating the need for direct data sharing. However, recent studies show that attackers can steal private data through model manipulation or gradient analysis. Existing attacks are constrained by low theft quantity or low-resolution data, and they are often detected through anomaly monitoring in gradients or weights. In this paper, we propose a novel data-reconstruction attack leveraging malicious code injection, supported by two key techniques, i.e., distinctive and sparse encoding design and block partitioning. Unlike conventional methods that require detectable changes to the model, our method stealthily embeds a hidden model using parameter sharing to systematically extract sensitive data. The Fibonacci-based index design ensures efficient, structured retrieval of memorized data, while the block partitioning method enhances our method's capability to handle high-resolution images by dividing them into smaller, manageable units. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets confirmed that our method is superior to the five state-of-the-art data-reconstruction attacks under the five respective detection methods. Our method can handle large-scale and high-resolution data without being detected or mitigated by state-of-the-art data reconstruction defense methods. In contrast to baselines, our method can be directly applied to both FedAVG and FedSGD scenarios, underscoring the need for developers to devise new defenses against such vulnerabilities. We will open-source our code upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Grid-augumented vision: A simple yet effective approach for enhanced spatial understanding in multi-modal agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in object recognition and scene understanding. However, these models often struggle with precise spatial localization - a critical capability for real-world applications. Inspired by how humans use grid-based references like chess boards and maps, we propose introducing explicit visual position encoding through a simple grid overlay approach. By adding a 9x9 black grid pattern onto input images, our method provides visual spatial guidance analogous to how positional encoding works in transformers, but in an explicit, visual form.
  Experiments on the COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our grid-based approach achieves significant improvements in localization accuracy, with a 107.4% increase in IoU (from 0.27 to 0.56) and a 194.4% improvement in GIoU (from 0.18 to 0.53) compared to baseline performance. Through attention visualization analysis, we show how this visual position encoding helps models better ground spatial relationships. Our method's simplicity and effectiveness make it particularly valuable for applications requiring accurate spatial reasoning, such as robotic manipulation, medical imaging, and autonomous navigation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nonlinear Function Approximation in Analog Resistive Crossbars for Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (IMC) has demonstrated energy-efficient and low latency implementation of convolution and fully-connected layers in deep neural networks (DNN) by using physics for computing in parallel resistive memory arrays. However, recurrent neural networks (RNN) that are widely used for speech-recognition and natural language processing have tasted limited success with this approach. This can be attributed to the significant time and energy penalties incurred in implementing nonlinear activation functions that are abundant in such models. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the implementation of a non-linear activation function integrated with a ramp analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) at the periphery of the memory to improve in-memory implementation of RNNs. Our approach uses an extra column of memristors to produce an appropriately pre-distorted ramp voltage such that the comparator output directly approximates the desired nonlinear function. We experimentally demonstrate programming different nonlinear functions using a memristive array and simulate its incorporation in RNNs to solve keyword spotting and language modelling tasks. Compared to other approaches, we demonstrate manifold increase in area-efficiency, energy-efficiency and throughput due to the in-memory, programmable ramp generator that removes digital processing overhead.</description>

      <title>NeoHebbian Synapses to Accelerate Online Training of Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic systems that employ advanced synaptic learning rules, such as the three-factor learning rule, require synaptic devices of increased complexity. Herein, a novel neoHebbian artificial synapse utilizing ReRAM devices has been proposed and experimentally validated to meet this demand. This synapse features two distinct state variables: a neuron coupling weight and an "eligibility trace" that dictates synaptic weight updates. The coupling weight is encoded in the ReRAM conductance, while the "eligibility trace" is encoded in the local temperature of the ReRAM and is modulated by applying voltage pulses to a physically co-located resistive heating element. The utility of the proposed synapse has been investigated using two representative tasks: first, temporal signal classification using Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) employing the e-prop algorithm, and second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for path planning tasks in feedforward networks using a modified version of the same learning rule. System-level simulations, accounting for various device and system-level non-idealities, confirm that these synapses offer a robust solution for the fast, compact, and energy-efficient implementation of advanced learning rules in neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that singular cohomology of the underlying space of Berkovich's analytification of a scheme $X$ locally of finite type over a trivially-valued field $k$ of characteristic $0$ is isomorphic to cdh-cohomology with integer coefficients which is also isomorphic to the weight zero motivic cohomology $H^*(X, \mathbb{Z})$. Using this isomorphism, we demonstrate the vanishing of $RHom_{Sh_{Nis}(cor_k)}(\underline{G},\mathbb{Z})$, where $\underline{G}$ denotes the Nisnevich sheaf with transfers associated with a commutative algebraic group $G$ over $k$. For abelian $k$-varieties $A$ and $B$, we prove that $RHom_{\mathcal{PS}h_{tr}}(\underline{A},\underline{B})$ is isomorphic to $Hom_{\mathbf{Ab_k}}(A,B)$.</description>

      <title>Visual Adversarial Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous driving (AD) by enhancing reasoning capabilities. However, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing research has primarily focused on general VLM attacks, the development of attacks tailored to the safety-critical AD context has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD, exposing the substantial risks these attacks pose within this critical domain. We identify two unique challenges for effective adversarial attacks on AD VLMs: the variability of textual instructions and the time-series nature of visual scenarios. To this end, we propose ADvLM, the first visual adversarial attack framework specifically designed for VLMs in AD. Our framework introduces Semantic-Invariant Induction, which uses a large language model to create a diverse prompt library of textual instructions with consistent semantic content, guided by semantic entropy. Building on this, we introduce Scenario-Associated Enhancement, an approach where attention mechanisms select key frames and perspectives within driving scenarios to optimize adversarial perturbations that generalize across the entire scenario. Extensive experiments on several AD VLMs over multiple benchmarks show that ADvLM achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness. Moreover, real-world attack studies further validate its applicability and potential in practice.</description>

      <title>GAPartManip: A Large-scale Part-centric Dataset for Material-Agnostic Articulated Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively manipulating articulated objects in household scenarios is a crucial step toward achieving general embodied artificial intelligence. Mainstream research in 3D vision has primarily focused on manipulation through depth perception and pose detection. However, in real-world environments, these methods often face challenges due to imperfect depth perception, such as with transparent lids and reflective handles. Moreover, they generally lack the diversity in part-based interactions required for flexible and adaptable manipulation. To address these challenges, we introduced a large-scale part-centric dataset for articulated object manipulation that features both photo-realistic material randomizations and detailed annotations of part-oriented, scene-level actionable interaction poses. We evaluated the effectiveness of our dataset by integrating it with several state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation and interaction pose prediction. Additionally, we proposed a novel modular framework that delivers superior and robust performance for generalizable articulated object manipulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the performance of depth perception and actionable interaction pose prediction in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In the era of 5G communication, the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is crucial for enhancing network performance. This paper explores the utilization of language models for spatial CSI prediction within MIMO-OFDM systems. We begin by outlining the significance of accurate CSI in enabling advanced functionalities such as adaptive modulation. We review existing methodologies for CSI estimation, emphasizing the shift from traditional to data-driven approaches. Then a novel framework for spatial CSI prediction using realistic environment information is proposed, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness. This research paves way for innovative strategies in managing wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals magnets has established a new domain in the field of magnetism, opening novel pathways for the electrical control of magnetic properties. In this context, Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) emerges as an exemplary candidate owing to its intrinsic metallic properties, which facilitate the interplay of both charge and spin degrees of freedom. Here, the bidirectional voltage control of exchange bias (EB) effect in a perpendicularly magnetized all-van der Waals FGT/O-FGT/hBN heterostructure is demonstrated. The antiferromagnetic O-FGT layer is formed by naturally oxidizing the FGT surface. The observed EB magnitude reaches 1.4 kOe with a blocking temperature (150 K) reaching close to the Curie temperature of FGT. Both the exchange field and the blocking temperature values are among the highest in the context of layered materials. The EB modulation exhibits a linear dependence on the gate voltage and its polarity, observable in both positive and negative field cooling (FC) experiments. Additionally, gate voltage-controlled magnetization switching, highlighting the potential of FGT-based heterostructures is demonstrated in advanced spintronic devices. These findings display a methodology to modulate the magnetism of van der Waals magnets offering new avenues for the development of high-performance magnetic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</description>

      <title>Neutralizing Backdoors through Information Conflicts for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, from understanding to reasoning. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses often suffer from drawbacks that they either focus on detection without removal, rely on rigid assumptions about trigger properties, or prove to be ineffective against advanced attacks like multi-trigger backdoors. In this paper, we present a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through the construction of information conflicts using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, we leverage a lightweight dataset to train a conflict model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by embedding contradictory information within the model's parametric memory. Externally, we incorporate convincing contradictory evidence into the prompt to challenge the model's internal backdoor knowledge. Experimental results on classification and conversational tasks across 4 widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms 8 state-of-the-art backdoor defense baselines. We can reduce the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining over 90% clean data accuracy. Furthermore, our method has proven to be robust against adaptive backdoor attacks. The code will be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>MotionCharacter: Identity-Preserving and Motion Controllable Human Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized Text-to-Video (T2V) generation highlight the importance of integrating character-specific identities and actions. However, previous T2V models struggle with identity consistency and controllable motion dynamics, mainly due to limited fine-grained facial and action-based textual prompts, and datasets that overlook key human attributes and actions. To address these challenges, we propose MotionCharacter, an efficient and high-fidelity human video generation framework designed for identity preservation and fine-grained motion control. We introduce an ID-preserving module to maintain identity fidelity while allowing flexible attribute modifications, and further integrate ID-consistency and region-aware loss mechanisms, significantly enhancing identity consistency and detail fidelity. Additionally, our approach incorporates a motion control module that prioritizes action-related text while maintaining subject consistency, along with a dataset, Human-Motion, which utilizes large language models to generate detailed motion descriptions. For simplify user control during inference, we parameterize motion intensity through a single coefficient, allowing for easy adjustments. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of MotionCharacter, demonstrating significant improvements in ID-preserving, high-quality video generation.</description>

      <title>Zeeman effect in oscillations of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields. Some of them (soft-gamma repeaters, SGRs) demonstrate gigantic flares which nature is still unclear. At decay phase of such flares one often observes quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) which are treated as stellar oscillations triggered by the flares. We study, for the first time, magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars possessing toroidal magnetic fields confined in the stellar crust, without imposing axial symmetry of perturbations. We show that the Zeeman effect makes the oscillation spectrum much richer than for axially symmetric oscillations. The main properties of theoretical QPO spectra are discussed as well as their potential to interpret observations and explore magnetar physics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic aeroacoustic instabilities in the crosstalk apertures of can-annular combustors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental and numerical study of aeroacoustic instabilities at the interface between neighbouring combustion chambers in modern heavy-duty gas turbines. A simplified laboratory-scale geometry of the gap separating the outlet of these chambers, just upstream of the turbine inlet in can-annular combustor architectures, is considered. It consists of two channels with anechoic and chocked conditions on the upstream and downstream sides respectively. Right before the choked-flow vanes which represent the turbine inlet, a small aperture leads to an aeroacoustic crosstalk between the channels. The dimensions and flow conditions are defined such that relevant Mach, Strouhal and Helmholtz numbers of gas turbines are reproduced. The alignment of the vanes with respect to the crosstalk aperture is varied. An intense whistling is observed for some conditions. The oscillation frequency depends on the aperture area and scales with the Strouhal number based on the aperture length. The upstream anechoic condition in each channel implies that no longitudinal acoustic mode participate to the mechanism of this whistling, which is in agreement with the Strouhal scaling of this intrinsic aeroacoustic instability. Compressible Large Eddy Simulations of the configuration have been performed and remarkably reproduce the whistling phenomenon. This work contributes to the understanding of aeroacoustic instabilities at the crosstalk apertures of can-annular combustors. It will help designing combustor-turbine interfaces to suppress them, which is important since the vibrations they induce may be as damaging as the ones from thermoacoustic instabilities.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that a closed $1$-rectifiable set $\Gamma_0\subset \mathbb R^2$ of finite $1$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and a vector field $u$ in a dimensionally critical Sobolev space are given. It is proved that, starting from $\Gamma_0$, there exists a non-trivial flow of curves with the velocity given by the sum of the curvature and the given vector field $u$.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the $N D^* \bar{K}^*$ system in the framework of the Fixed Center Approximation to the Faddeev equations, taking the exotic $D^* \bar{K}^* $ system as the cluster and allowing the N to interact with the components of the cluster. Previous studies have determined the existence of three states of spin $0,1,2$ for the $D^* \bar{K}^* $ system, the one of spin $0$ associated to the $X_0(2900)$ state observed by the LHCb collaboration. From this perspective, we find five states with total spin $1/2,3/2,5/2$, with bindings from $10$ to $30$ MeV and widths below $60$ MeV, which could be well identified. We also discuss the decay channels of these states that should help in future experimental searches of these states.</description>

      <title>DualCast: Disentangling Aperiodic Events from Traffic Series with a Dual-Branch Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic forecasting is an important problem in the operation and optimisation of transportation systems. State-of-the-art solutions train machine learning models by minimising the mean forecasting errors on the training data. The trained models often favour periodic events instead of aperiodic ones in their prediction results, as periodic events often prevail in the training data. While offering critical optimisation opportunities, aperiodic events such as traffic incidents may be missed by the existing models. To address this issue, we propose DualCast -- a model framework to enhance the learning capability of traffic forecasting models, especially for aperiodic events. DualCast takes a dual-branch architecture, to disentangle traffic signals into two types, one reflecting intrinsic {spatial-temporal} patterns and the other reflecting external environment contexts including aperiodic events. We further propose a cross-time attention mechanism, to capture high-order spatial-temporal relationships from both periodic and aperiodic patterns. DualCast is versatile. We integrate it with recent traffic forecasting models, consistently reducing their forecasting errors by up to 9.6% on multiple real datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multispectral Object Detection: A Bag of Tricks and Comprehensive Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispectral object detection, utilizing RGB and TIR (thermal infrared) modalities, is widely recognized as a challenging task. It requires not only the effective extraction of features from both modalities and robust fusion strategies, but also the ability to address issues such as spectral discrepancies, spatial misalignment, and environmental dependencies between RGB and TIR images. These challenges significantly hinder the generalization of multispectral detection systems across diverse scenarios. Although numerous studies have attempted to overcome these limitations, it remains difficult to clearly distinguish the performance gains of multispectral detection systems from the impact of these "optimization techniques". Worse still, despite the rapid emergence of high-performing single-modality detection models, there is still a lack of specialized training techniques that can effectively adapt these models for multispectral detection tasks. The absence of a standardized benchmark with fair and consistent experimental setups also poses a significant barrier to evaluating the effectiveness of new approaches. To this end, we propose the first fair and reproducible benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the training "techniques", which systematically classifies existing multispectral object detection methods, investigates their sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and standardizes the core configurations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted across multiple representative multispectral object detection datasets, utilizing various backbone networks and detection frameworks. Additionally, we introduce an efficient and easily deployable multispectral object detection framework that can seamlessly optimize high-performing single-modality models into dual-modality models, integrating our advanced training techniques.</description>

      <title>Don't Let Your Robot be Harmful: Responsible Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unthinking execution of human instructions in robotic manipulation can lead to severe safety risks, such as poisonings, fires, and even explosions. In this paper, we present responsible robotic manipulation, which requires robots to consider potential hazards in the real-world environment while completing instructions and performing complex operations safely and efficiently. However, such scenarios in real world are variable and risky for training. To address this challenge, we propose Safety-as-policy, which includes (i) a world model to automatically generate scenarios containing safety risks and conduct virtual interactions, and (ii) a mental model to infer consequences with reflections and gradually develop the cognition of safety, allowing robots to accomplish tasks while avoiding dangers. Additionally, we create the SafeBox synthetic dataset, which includes one hundred responsible robotic manipulation tasks with different safety risk scenarios and instructions, effectively reducing the risks associated with real-world experiments. Experiments demonstrate that Safety-as-policy can avoid risks and efficiently complete tasks in both synthetic dataset and real-world experiments, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Our SafeBox dataset shows consistent evaluation results with real-world scenarios, serving as a safe and effective benchmark for future research.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semantic Asymmetry for Precise Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Planning CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), clinicians typically delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) using non-contrast planning computed tomography to ensure accurate radiation dose delivery. However, the low contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues necessitates that radiation oncologists manually delineate the tumors, often relying on diagnostic MRI for guidance. % In this study, we propose a novel approach to directly segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT images, circumventing potential registration errors when aligning MRI or MRI-derived tumor masks to planning CT. To address the low contrast issues between tumors and adjacent normal structures in planning CT, we introduce a 3D Semantic Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method. Specifically, we posit that a healthy nasopharyngeal region is characteristically bilaterally symmetric, whereas the emergence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma disrupts this symmetry. Then, we propose a Siamese contrastive learning segmentation framework that minimizes the voxel-wise distance between original and flipped areas without tumor and encourages a larger distance between original and flipped areas with tumor. Thus, our approach enhances the sensitivity of features to semantic asymmetries. % Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SATs achieves the leading NPC GTV segmentation performance in both internal and external testing, \emph{e.g.}, with at least 2\% absolute Dice score improvement and 12\% average distance error reduction when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the external testing.</description>

      <title>A Faster Deterministic Algorithm for Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-Path Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with a set of terminals $T\subseteq V$ partitioned into a family $\mathcal{S}$ of disjoint blocks, find the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths whose endpoints belong to two distinct blocks while no other internal vertex is a terminal. This problem is called Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-path packing. It has been of remarkable interest as a common generalization of the non-bipartite matching and vertex-disjoint $s\text{-}t$ paths problem.
  This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for this problem via known reduction to linear matroid parity. The algorithm utilizes the augmenting-path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986), while replacing costly matrix operations between augmentation steps with a faster algorithm that exploits the original $\mathcal{S}$-path packing instance. The proposed algorithm runs in $O(mnk)$ time, where $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$, and $k = |T|\le n$. This improves on the previous best bound $O(mn^{\omega})$ for deterministic algorithms, where $\omega\ge2$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <title>HiFiVFS: High Fidelity Video Face Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face swapping aims to generate results that combine the identity from the source with attributes from the target. Existing methods primarily focus on image-based face swapping. When processing videos, each frame is handled independently, making it difficult to ensure temporal stability. From a model perspective, face swapping is gradually shifting from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to diffusion models (DMs), as DMs have been shown to possess stronger generative capabilities. Current diffusion-based approaches often employ inpainting techniques, which struggle to preserve fine-grained attributes like lighting and makeup. To address these challenges, we propose a high fidelity video face swapping (HiFiVFS) framework, which leverages the strong generative capability and temporal prior of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD). We build a fine-grained attribute module to extract identity-disentangled and fine-grained attribute features through identity desensitization and adversarial learning. Additionally, We introduce detailed identity injection to further enhance identity similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in video face swapping, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Aligning Pre-trained Models for Spoken Language Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to end-to-end speech translation (ST) based on aligning frozen pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) models via a small connector module (Q-Former, our Subsampler-Transformer Encoder). This connector bridges the gap between the speech and text modalities, transforming ASR encoder embeddings into the latent representation space of the MT encoder while being the only part of the system optimized during training. Experiments are conducted on the How2 English-Portuguese dataset as we investigate the alignment approach in a small-scale scenario focusing on ST. While keeping the size of the connector module constant and small in comparison ( &lt; 5% of the size of the larger aligned models), increasing the size and capability of the foundation ASR and MT models universally improves translation results. We also find that the connectors can serve as domain adapters for the foundation MT models, significantly improving translation performance in the aligned ST setting. We conclude that this approach represents a viable and scalable approach to training end-to-end ST systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing energy consumption for legged robot by adapting equilibrium position and stiffness of a parallel torsion spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the development of a novel adaptive torsion spring mechanism for optimizing energy consumption in legged robots. By adjusting the equilibrium position and stiffness of the spring, the system improves energy efficiency during cyclic movements, such as walking and jumping. The adaptive compliance mechanism, consisting of a torsion spring combined with a worm gear driven by a servo actuator, compensates for motion-induced torque and reduces motor load. Simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in power consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing robotic locomotion.</description>

      <title>HUPE: Heuristic Underwater Perceptual Enhancement with Semantic Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater images are often affected by light refraction and absorption, reducing visibility and interfering with subsequent applications. Existing underwater image enhancement methods primarily focus on improving visual quality while overlooking practical implications. To strike a balance between visual quality and application, we propose a heuristic invertible network for underwater perception enhancement, dubbed HUPE, which enhances visual quality and demonstrates flexibility in handling other downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduced an information-preserving reversible transformation with embedded Fourier transform to establish a bidirectional mapping between underwater images and their clear images. Additionally, a heuristic prior is incorporated into the enhancement process to better capture scene information. To further bridge the feature gap between vision-based enhancement images and application-oriented images, a semantic collaborative learning module is applied in the joint optimization process of the visual enhancement task and the downstream task, which guides the proposed enhancement model to extract more task-oriented semantic features while obtaining visually pleasing images. Extensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superiority of our HUPE over state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>The distribution of the largest digit for parabolic Iterated Function Systems of the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the largest digit for a wide class of infinite parabolic Iterated Function Systems (IFSs) of the unit interval. Due to the recurrence to parabolic (neutral) fixed points, the dimension analysis of these systems become more delicate than that of uniformly contracting IFSs. We show that the Hausdorff dimensions of level sets associated with the largest digits are constantly equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the IFS. This result is an analogue of Wu and Xu's theorem [Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. {\bf 146} (2009), 207--212] on the regular continued fraction. Examples of application of our result include the backward (aka minus, or negative) continued fractions, even integer continued fractions, and go beyond. Our main technical tool is a dimension theory for non-uniformly expanding Markov interval maps with infinitely many branches.</description>

      <title>Capacity Maximization for MIMO Channels Assisted by Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can improve the capacity of wireless communication links by passively beamforming the impinging signals in desired directions. This feature has been demonstrated both analytically and experimentally for conventional RISs, consisting of independently reflecting elements. To further enhance reconfigurability, a new architecture called beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed. It allows for controllable signal flows between RIS elements, resulting in a non-diagonal reflection matrix, unlike the conventional RIS architecture. Previous studies on BD-RIS-assisted communications have predominantly considered single-antenna transmitters/receivers. One recent work provides an iterative capacity-improving algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups but without providing geometrical insights.
  In this paper, we derive the first closed-form capacity-maximizing BD-RIS reflection matrix for a MIMO channel. We describe how this solution pairs together propagation paths, how it behaves when the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and what capacity is achievable with ideal semi-unitary channel matrices. The analytical results are corroborated numerically.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization from accretion disk winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry is a fine tool to probe the accretion geometry and physical processes operating in the proximity of compact objects, black holes and neutron stars. Recent discoveries made by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer put our understanding of the accretion picture in question. The observed high levels of X-ray polarization in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are challenging to achieve within the conventional scenarios. In this work we investigate a possibility that a fraction (or even all) of the observed polarized signal arises from scattering in the equatorial accretion disk winds, the slow and extended outflows, which are often detected in these systems via spectroscopic means. We find that the wind scattering can reproduce the levels of polarization observed in these sources.</description>

      <title>Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing MMDiT-Based Text-to-Image Models for Similar Subject Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing the cutting-edge technique of text-to-image models, the latest Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) largely mitigates many generation issues existing in previous models. However, we discover that it still suffers from subject neglect or mixing when the input text prompt contains multiple subjects of similar semantics or appearance. We identify three possible ambiguities within the MMDiT architecture that cause this problem: Inter-block Ambiguity, Text Encoder Ambiguity, and Semantic Ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose to repair the ambiguous latent on-the-fly by test-time optimization at early denoising steps. In detail, we design three loss functions: Block Alignment Loss, Text Encoder Alignment Loss, and Overlap Loss, each tailored to mitigate these ambiguities. Despite significant improvements, we observe that semantic ambiguity persists when generating multiple similar subjects, as the guidance provided by overlap loss is not explicit enough. Therefore, we further propose Overlap Online Detection and Back-to-Start Sampling Strategy to alleviate the problem. Experimental results on a newly constructed challenging dataset of similar subjects validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing superior generation quality and much higher success rates over existing methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wtybest/EnMMDiT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driving interaction-a critical yet complex aspect of daily driving-lies at the core of autonomous driving research. However, real-world driving scenarios sparsely capture rich interaction events, limiting the availability of comprehensive trajectory datasets for this purpose. To address this challenge, we present InterHub, a dense interaction dataset derived by mining interaction events from extensive naturalistic driving records. We employ formal methods to describe and extract multi-agent interaction events, exposing the limitations of existing autonomous driving solutions. Additionally, we introduce a user-friendly toolkit enabling the expansion of InterHub with both public and private data. By unifying, categorizing, and analyzing diverse interaction events, InterHub facilitates cross-comparative studies and large-scale research, thereby advancing the evaluation and development of autonomous driving technologies.</description>

      <title>InfiniDreamer: Arbitrarily Long Human Motion Generation via Segment Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present InfiniDreamer, a novel framework for arbitrarily long human motion generation. InfiniDreamer addresses the limitations of current motion generation methods, which are typically restricted to short sequences due to the lack of long motion training data. To achieve this, we first generate sub-motions corresponding to each textual description and then assemble them into a coarse, extended sequence using randomly initialized transition segments. We then introduce an optimization-based method called Segment Score Distillation (SSD) to refine the entire long motion sequence. SSD is designed to utilize an existing motion prior, which is trained only on short clips, in a training-free manner. Specifically, SSD iteratively refines overlapping short segments sampled from the coarsely extended long motion sequence, progressively aligning them with the pre-trained motion diffusion prior. This process ensures local coherence within each segment, while the refined transitions between segments maintain global consistency across the entire sequence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the superiority of our framework, showcasing its ability to generate coherent, contextually aware motion sequences of arbitrary length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons' frequency degree of freedom is promising to realize large-scale quantum information processing. Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators can produce multiple frequency modes with narrow linewidth. Here, we utilize polarization-entangled QFCs to generate discrete frequency-bin entangled states. Fourteen pairs of polarization-entangled photons with different frequencies are simultaneously transformed into frequency-bin entangled states. The characteristic of frequency-bin entanglement is demonstrated by Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, which can be performed with single or multiple frequency pairs in parallel. Our work paves the way for harnessing large-scale frequency-bin entanglement and converting between different degrees of freedom in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Application of Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms in Optimizing Wastewater Treatment with Time Delays Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants face unique challenges for process control due to their complex dynamics, slow time constants, and stochastic delays in observations and actions. These characteristics make conventional control methods, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers, suboptimal for achieving efficient phosphorus removal, a critical component of wastewater treatment to ensure environmental sustainability. This study addresses these challenges using a novel deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, integrated with a custom simulator designed to model the delayed feedback inherent in wastewater treatment plants. The simulator incorporates Long Short-Term Memory networks for accurate multi-step state predictions, enabling realistic training scenarios. To account for the stochastic nature of delays, agents were trained under three delay scenarios: no delay, constant delay, and random delay. The results demonstrate that incorporating random delays into the reinforcement learning framework significantly improves phosphorus removal efficiency while reducing operational costs. Specifically, the delay-aware agent achieved 36% reduction in phosphorus emissions, 55% higher reward, 77% lower target deviation from the regulatory limit, and 9% lower total costs than traditional control methods in the simulated environment. These findings underscore the potential of reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of conventional control strategies in wastewater treatment, providing an adaptive and cost-effective solution for phosphorus removal.</description>

      <title>Delineating Feminist Studies through bibliometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multidisciplinary and socially anchored nature of Feminist Studies presents unique challenges for bibliometric analysis, as this research area transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and reflects discussions from feminist and LGBTQIA+ social movements. This paper proposes a novel approach for identifying gender/sex related publications scattered across diverse scientific disciplines. Using the Dimensions database, we employ bibliometric techniques, natural language processing (NLP) and manual curation to compile a dataset of scientific publications that allows for the analysis of Gender Studies and its influence across different disciplines.
  This is achieved through a methodology that combines a core of specialized journals with a comprehensive keyword search over titles. These keywords are obtained by applying Topic Modeling (BERTopic) to the corpus of titles and abstracts from the core. This methodological strategy, divided into two stages, reflects the dynamic interaction between Gender Studies and its dialogue with different disciplines. This hybrid system surpasses basic keyword search by mitigating potential biases introduced through manual keyword enumeration.
  The resulting dataset comprises over 1.9 million scientific documents published between 1668 and 2023, spanning four languages. This dataset enables a characterization of Gender Studies in terms of addressed topics, citation and collaboration dynamics, and institutional and regional participation. By addressing the methodological challenges of studying "more-than-disciplinary" research areas, this approach could also be adapted to delineate other conversations where disciplinary boundaries are difficult to disentangle.</description>

      <title>Spatial separation of closely-spaced users in measured distributed massive MIMO channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming for the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications, distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems hold significant potential for spatial multiplexing. In order to evaluate the ability of a distributed massive MIMO system to spatially separate closely spaced users, this paper presents an indoor channel measurement campaign. The measurements are carried out at a carrier frequency of 5.6 GHz with a bandwidth of 400 MHz, employing distributed antenna arrays with a total of 128 elements. Multiple scalar metrics are selected to evaluate spatial separability in line-of-sight, non line-of-sight, and mixed conditions. Firstly, through studying the singular value spread, it is shown that in line-of-sight conditions, better user orthogonality is achieved with a distributed MIMO setup compared to a co-located MIMO array. Furthermore, the dirty-paper coding (DPC) capacity and zero forcing (ZF) precoding sum-rate capacities are investigated across varying numbers of antennas and their topologies. The results show that in all three conditions, the less complex ZF precoder can be applied in distributed massive MIMO systems while still achieving a large fraction of the DPC capacity. Additionally, in line-of-sight conditions, both sum-rate capacities and user fairness benefit from more antennas and a more distributed antenna topology. However, in the given NLoS condition, the improvement in spatial separability through distributed antenna topologies is limited.</description>

Abstract: Compute Express Link (CXL) is a promising technology that addresses memory and storage challenges. Despite its advantages, CXL faces performance threats from external interference when co-existing with current memory and storage systems. This interference is under-explored in existing research. To address this, we develop CXL-Interplay, systematically characterizing and analyzing interference from memory and storage systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to characterize CXL interference on real CXL hardware. We also provide reverse-reasoning analysis with performance counters and kernel functions. In the end, we propose and evaluate mitigating solutions.</description>

      <title>MvKeTR: Chest CT Report Generation with Multi-View Perception and Knowledge Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care. Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced Tansformer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention effectively synthesizes diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) retrieves the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with learnable nonlinear activation functions as the fundamental building blocks of both modules to better capture intricate diagnostic patterns in CT interpretation. Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548K dataset demonstrate that our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art models across all metrics.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of the open Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models are fundamental to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, as they describe the simplest form of light-matter interaction, where a single qubit is coupled to a single bosonic mode. A scenario that is commonly encountered in the experimental practice arises when the bosonic mode interacts with an external dissipative thermal bath, making the qubit-boson system open. In this work, we present new analytical solutions of the Lindblad master equations for the open Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models in the limit of weak qubit-boson coupling $g$, using the holomorphic formalism in Bargmann space. Specifically, we derive the most general solution of the local Lindblad master equation for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model coupled to a thermal bath, with the only assumptions that the initial state of the qubit-boson system is separable. Additionally, we obtain a perturbative analytical solution for the open quantum Rabi model up to second order in $g$. Notably, our findings include a new formula for the qubit's steady state at zeroth order, showing that the stationary populations depend on both qubit and boson frequencies in the quantum Rabi model, but not in the Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results are of general interest to the study of open quantum systems in the context of light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Neural Surface Priors for Editable Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computer graphics, there is a need to recover easily modifiable representations of 3D geometry and appearance from image data. We introduce a novel method for this task using 3D Gaussian Splatting, which enables intuitive scene editing through mesh adjustments. Starting with input images and camera poses, we reconstruct the underlying geometry using a neural Signed Distance Field and extract a high-quality mesh. Our model then estimates a set of Gaussians, where each component is flat, and the opacity is conditioned on the recovered neural surface. To facilitate editing, we produce a proxy representation that encodes information about the Gaussians' shape and position. Unlike other methods, our pipeline allows modifications applied to the extracted mesh to be propagated to the proxy representation, from which we recover the updated parameters of the Gaussians. This effectively transfers the mesh edits back to the recovered appearance representation. By leveraging mesh-guided transformations, our approach simplifies 3D scene editing and offers improvements over existing methods in terms of usability and visual fidelity of edits.

      <title>Undirected 3-Fault Replacement Path in Nearly Cubic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and two vertices $s,t\in V$, the $f$-fault replacement path ($f$FRP) problem computes for every set of edges $F$ where $|F|\leq f$, the distance from $s$ to $t$ when edges in $F$ fail. A recent result shows that 2FRP in directed graphs can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time [arXiv:2209.07016]. In this paper, we show a 3FRP algorithm in deterministic $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time for undirected weighted graphs, which almost matches the size of the output. This implies that $f$FRP in undirected graphs can be solved in almost optimal $\tilde{O}(n^f)$ time for all $f\geq 3$. To construct our 3FRP algorithm, we introduce an incremental distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) with $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ worst-case update time, while preprocessing time, space, and query time are still $\tilde{O}(n^3)$, $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(1)$, respectively, which match the static DSO [Bernstein and Karger 2009]. Here in a DSO, we can preprocess a graph so that the distance between any pair of vertices given any failed edge can be answered efficiently. From the recent result in [arXiv:2211.05178], we can obtain an offline dynamic DSO from the incremental worst-case DSO, which makes the construction of our 3FRP algorithm more convenient. By the offline dynamic DSO, we can also construct a 2-fault single-source replacement path (2-fault SSRP) algorithm in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time, that is, from a given vertex $s$, we want to find the distance to any vertex $t$ when any pair of edges fail. Thus the $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time complexity for 2-fault SSRP is also almost optimal. Now we know that in undirected graphs 1FRP can be solved in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time [Nardelli, Proietti, Widmayer 2001], and 2FRP and 3FRP in undirected graphs can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time. In this paper, we also show that a truly subcubic algorithm for 2FRP in undirected graphs does not exist under APSP-hardness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observable convolutional codes defined over Zpr with the Predictable Degree Property admits minimal input state output representations that behaves well under restriction of scalars. We make use of this fact to present Rosenthal's decoding algorithm for these convolutional codes. When combined with the Greferath-Vellbinger algorithm and a modified version of the Torrecillas-Lobillo-Navarro algorithm, the decoding problem reduces to selecting two decoding algorithms for linear block codes over a field. Finally, we analyze both the theoretical and practical error-correction capabilities of the combined algorithm,</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Agility and Reconfigurability in Satellite Systems for Tropical Cyclone Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly dynamic natural disasters that travel vast distances and occupy a large spatial scale, leading to loss of life, economic strife, and destruction of infrastructure. The severe impact of TCs makes them crucial to monitor such that the collected data contributes to forecasting their trajectory and severity, as well as the provision of information to relief agencies. Among the various methods used to monitor TCs, Earth observation satellites are the most flexible, allowing for frequent observations with a wide variety of instruments. Traditionally, satellite scheduling algorithms assume nadir-directional observations, a limitation that can be alleviated by incorporating satellite agility and constellation reconfigurability -- two state-of-the-art concepts of operations (CONOPS) that extend the amount of time TCs can be observed from orbit. This paper conducts a systematic comparative analysis between both CONOPS to present the performance of each relative to baseline nadir-directional observations in monitoring TCs. A dataset of 100 historical TCs is used to provide a benchmark concerning real-world data through maximizing the number of quality observations. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that constellation reconfigurability allowing plane-change maneuvers outperforms satellite agility in the majority of TCs analyzed.</description>

      <title>SRG Analysis of Lur'e Systems and the Generalized Circle Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from some pitfalls that limit its applicability in analysing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome these pitfalls by modifying the SRG of a linear time invariant operator, combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion, and apply our result to Lur'e systems. We thereby obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and provides (incremental) $L^2$-gain performance bounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of the controlled Duffing oscillator.</description>

      <title>Lighthouse: An Open Research Framework for Optical Data Center Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical data center networks (DCNs) are emerging as a promising design for cloud infrastructure. However, existing optical DCN architectures operate as closed ecosystems, tying software solutions to specific optical hardware. We introduce Lighthouse, an open research framework that decouples software from hardware, allowing them to evolve independently. Central to Lighthouse is the time-flow table abstraction, serving as a common interface between optical hardware and software. We develop Lighthouse on programmable switches, achieving a minimum optical circuit duration of 2 {\mu}s, the shortest duration realized by commodity devices to date. We demonstrate Lighthouse's generality by implementing six optical architectures on an optical testbed and conducted extensive benchmarks on a 108-ToR setup, highlighting system efficiency. Additionally, we present case studies that identify potential research topics enabled by Lighthouse.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning in Machine Speech Chain Using Gradient Episodic Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems poses a challenge, especially with the need to avoid catastrophic forgetting while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging the machine speech chain framework to enable continual learning in ASR using gradient episodic memory (GEM). By incorporating a text-to-speech (TTS) component within the machine speech chain, we support the replay mechanism essential for GEM, allowing the ASR model to learn new tasks sequentially without significant performance degradation on earlier tasks. Our experiments, conducted on the LJ Speech dataset, demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional fine-tuning and multitask learning approaches, achieving a substantial error rate reduction while maintaining high performance across varying noise conditions. We showed the potential of our semi-supervised machine speech chain approach for effective and efficient continual learning in speech recognition.</description>

      <title>Learning optimal objective values for MILP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers use the Branch-and-Bound algorithm together with a plethora of auxiliary components that speed up the search. In recent years, there has been an explosive development in the use of machine learning for enhancing and supporting these algorithmic components. Within this line, we propose a methodology for predicting the optimal objective value, or, equivalently, predicting if the current incumbent is optimal. For this task, we introduce a predictor based on a graph neural network (GNN) architecture, together with a set of dynamic features. Experimental results on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving high accuracy in the prediction task and outperforming existing methods. These findings suggest new opportunities for integrating ML-driven predictions into MILP solvers, enabling smarter decision-making and improved performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promising potential for parameter-efficient scaling across various domains. However, the implementation in computer vision remains limited, and often requires large-scale datasets comprising billions of samples. In this study, we investigate the integration of MoE within computer vision models and explore various MoE configurations on open datasets. When introducing MoE layers in image classification, the best results are obtained for models with a moderate number of activated parameters per sample. However, such improvements gradually vanish when the number of parameters per sample increases.</description>

      <title>CP violation observables in baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of baryon physics is on the horizon with the accumulation of increasing data by collaborations such as LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII. Despite the wealth of data, one of the critical issues in flavor physics, namely CP violation in baryon decays, still awaits experimental confirmation. It is evident that the development of formulas and phenomenological analyses will play a pivotal role in advancing theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in this domain. In this work, we discuss the fundamental definitions and properties of polarization, asymmetry parameters and their associated CP violating observables that may arise in baryon decays. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of b-baryon quasi-two and -three body decays based on angular distributions. We highlight the significance of CP asymmetries defined by spin and momentum correlations, as non-trivial spin distributions are expected in baryon decays due to their non-zero polarization in productions and decays. Of particular importance is a complementary relation can be establised for two different types of observables, that are $\mathcal{T}$-even and -odd CP asymmetries respectively. The complementarity indicates that one observable exhibits the sine dependence on strong phase $\Delta\delta$, while another exhibits as cosine. This gives us an distinctive opportunity to avoid the potential large suppression to CP asymmetries from small phase $\Delta\delta$. Two points (\textbf{i}) the exact proof of strong phase dependence behaviour, and (\textbf{ii}) the criterion for complementary observables are clarified. Based on these arguments from theoretical aside, some brief discussions and suggestions on experimental measurements are offered in the final discussions.

      <title>RITA: Automatic Framework for Designing of Resilient IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing resilient Internet of Things (IoT) systems requires i) identification of IoT Critical Objects (ICOs) such as services, devices, and resources, ii) threat analysis, and iii) mitigation strategy selection. However, the traditional process for designing resilient IoT systems is still manual, leading to inefficiencies and increased risks. In addition, while tools such as ChatGPT could support this manual and highly error-prone process, their use raises concerns over data privacy, inconsistent outputs, and internet dependence. Therefore, we propose RITA, an automated, open-source framework that uses a fine-tuned RoBERTa-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify ICOs from IoT requirement documents, correlate threats, and recommend countermeasures. RITA operates entirely offline and can be deployed on-site, safeguarding sensitive information and delivering consistent outputs that enhance standardization. In our empirical evaluation, RITA outperformed ChatGPT in four of seven ICO categories, particularly in actuator, sensor, network resource, and service identification, using both human-annotated and ChatGPT-generated test data. These findings indicate that RITA can improve resilient IoT design by effectively supporting key security operations, offering a practical solution for developing robust IoT architectures.</description>

      <title>Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free Josephson diode (JD) based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</description>

      <title>In-situ observations of resident space objects with the CHEOPS space telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a partnership between the European Space Agency and Switzerland with important contributions by 10 additional ESA member States. It is the first S-class mission in the ESA Science Programme. CHEOPS has been flying on a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit since December 2019, collecting millions of short-exposure images in the visible domain to study exoplanet properties. A small yet increasing fraction of CHEOPS images show linear trails caused by resident space objects crossing the instrument field of view. To characterize the population of satellites and orbital debris observed by CHEOPS, all and every science images acquired over the past 3 years have been scanned with a Hough transform algorithm to identify the characteristic linear features that these objects cause on the images. Thousands of trails have been detected. This statistically significant sample shows interesting trends and features such as an increased occurrence rate over the past years as well as the fingerprint of the Starlink constellation. The cross-matching of individual trails with catalogued objects is underway as we aim to measure their distance at the time of observation and deduce the apparent magnitude of the detected objects. As space agencies and private companies are developing new space-based surveillance and tracking activities to catalogue and characterize the distribution of small debris, the CHEOPS experience is timely and relevant. With the first CHEOPS mission extension currently running until the end of 2026, and a possible second extension until the end of 2029, the longer time coverage will make our dataset even more valuable to the community, especially for characterizing objects with recurrent crossings.</description>

      <title>Using Malware Detection Techniques for HPC Application Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HPC systems face security and compliance challenges, particularly in preventing waste and misuse of computational resources by unauthorized or malicious software that deviates from allocation purpose. Existing methods to classify applications based on job names or resource usage are often unreliable or fail to capture applications that have different behavior due to different inputs or system noise. This research proposes an approach that uses similarity-preserving fuzzy hashes to classify HPC application executables. By comparing the similarity of SSDeep fuzzy hashes, a Random Forest Classifier can accurately label applications executing on HPC systems including unknown samples. We evaluate the Fuzzy Hash Classifier on a dataset of 92 application classes and 5333 distinct application samples. The proposed method achieved a macro f1-score of 90% (micro f1-score: 89%, weighted f1-score: 90%). Our approach addresses the critical need for more effective application classification in HPC environments, minimizing resource waste, and enhancing security and compliance.</description>

      <title>EventCrab: Harnessing Frame and Point Synergy for Event-based Action Recognition and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) possesses the advantages of high-temporal resolution capturing and privacy preservation compared with traditional action recognition. Current leading EAR solutions typically follow two regimes: project unconstructed event streams into dense constructed event frames and adopt powerful frame-specific networks, or employ lightweight point-specific networks to handle sparse unconstructed event points directly. However, such two regimes are blind to a fundamental issue: failing to accommodate the unique dense temporal and sparse spatial properties of asynchronous event data. In this article, we present a synergy-aware framework, i.e., EventCrab, that adeptly integrates the "lighter" frame-specific networks for dense event frames with the "heavier" point-specific networks for sparse event points, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a joint frame-text-point representation space to bridge distinct event frames and points. In specific, to better exploit the unique spatiotemporal relationships inherent in asynchronous event points, we devise two strategies for the "heavier" point-specific embedding: i) a Spiking-like Context Learner (SCL) that extracts contextualized event points from raw event streams. ii) an Event Point Encoder (EPE) that further explores event-point long spatiotemporal features in a Hilbert-scan way. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the significant performance of our proposed EventCrab, particularly gaining improvements of 5.17% on SeAct and 7.01% on HARDVS.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Digital Twin Assisted Model Interference and Retraining over Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a resource allocation and model retraining problem for dynamic wireless networks by utilizing incremental learning, in which the digital twin (DT) scheme is employed for decision making. A two-timescale framework is proposed for computation resource allocation, mobile user association, and incremental training of user models. To obtain an optimal resource allocation and incremental learning policy, we propose an efficient two-timescale scheme based on hybrid DT-physical architecture with the objective to minimize long-term system delay. Specifically, in the large-timescale, base stations will update the user association and implement incremental learning decisions based on statistical state information from the DT system. Then, in the short timescale, an effective computation resource allocation and incremental learning data generated from the DT system is designed based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), thus reducing the network system's delay in data transmission, data computation, and model retraining steps. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-timescale scheme compared with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>QUADOL: A Quality-Driven Approximate Logic Synthesis Method Exploiting Dual-Output LUTs for Modern FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate computing is a new computing paradigm. One important area of it is designing approximate circuits for FPGA. Modern FPGAs support dual-output LUT, which can significantly reduce the area of FPGA designs. Several existing works explored the use of dual-output in approximate computing. However, they are limited to small-scale arithmetic circuits. To address the problem, this work proposes QUADOL, a quality-driven ALS method by exploiting dual-output LUTs for modern FPGAs. We propose a technique to approximately merge two single-output LUTs (i.e., a LUT pair) into a dual-output LUT. In addition, we transform the problem of selecting multiple LUT pairs for simultaneous approximate merging into a maximum matching problem to maximize the area reduction. Since QUADOL exploits a new dimension, i.e., approximately merging a LUT pair into a dual-output LUT, it can be integrated with any existing ALS methods to strengthen them. Therefore, we also introduce QUADOL+, which is a generic framework to integrate QUADOL into existing ALS methods. The experimental results showed that QUADOL+ can reduce the LUT count by up to 18% compared to the state-of-the-art ALS methods for FPGA. Moreover, the approximate multipliers optimized by QUADOL+ dominate most prior FPGA-based approximate multipliers in the area-error plane.</description>

      <title>Chemo-Structural Disorder in the kagom\'e spin $S$ = 1/2 systems ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ and YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By single crystal diffraction we characterize the chemo-structural disorder introduced by Zn-Cu site mixing in the kagom\'e spin $S$-1/2 systems herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ and YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$]. For an untwinned single crystal of herbertsmithite of composition Zn$_{0.95(1)}$Cu$_{2.99(3)}$O$_{5.9(1)}$H$_{5.8(1)}$Cl$_2$ we find substitution by Cu of the Zn atoms in the layers separating the kagom\'e layers as well as substantial Zn substitution for Cu in the kagom\'e layers. In YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$] site mixing disorder is present for intermediate $x$. Analogous to the Cl homologous system in crystals with $x = 1/3$ disorder is absent and a low-temperature structural transition emerges driven by strong magneto-phonon coupling as a release of frustration. Apart from this structural anomaly we find the physical properties of these crystals unchanged compared to intermediate $x$ and closely resembling the Cl homologue where long-range magnetic order was observed.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Skyrmion and Skyrmion Bags Explored under the Influence of Out-of-Plane Strain and Its Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions as well as skyrmion bags in magnetic thin films are promising candidates for future high-density memory devices. The observation of skyrmion bags in liquid crystals and their predicted existence in ferromagnetic films has sparked theoretical studies on current induced dynamics of these topological charges. Here using micromagnetism, we study the impact of out of plane strain on the stability of skyrmion and skyrmion bags in ferromagnetic thin film. We further studied the current induced dynamics in the presence of out of plane strain gradient. We demonstrate that out of plane strain gradient direction with respect to the electron flow can be an efficient way to control the dynamics of topological charges. Specifically, the deflection of skyrmion bags correlates with their topological degree, and an appropriate strain gradient can counteract skyrmion Hall effects, enabling straight-line movement. Our micromagnetic simulations align well with theoretical predictions from the Thiele equation.</description>

      <title>Di-Exact Categories and Lattices of Normal Subobjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study certain categorical-algebraic frameworks for basic homological algebra, introduced in arXiv:2404.15896, with the aim of better understanding the differences between them. We focus on homological self-duality, preservation of normal maps by dinversion and diexactness, finding counterexamples that separate any two of these conditions. On the way, we encounter new examples and new characterizations, such as the Second Isomorphism Property. We also consider homological self-duality in the context of regular categories. Our main technique is to investigate the lattice of normal subobjects of an object in any pointed category with kernels and cokernels. The category of monoidal semilattices is a context where we have easy control of these lattices. We show that properties of the homological frameworks under consideration may be expressed by means of lattice-theoretical properties, such as modularity and distributivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-smoothing is a technique aimed at increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in data to improve subsequent estimation and model selection in regression problems. However, pre-smoothing has thus far been limited to the univariate response regression setting. Motivated by the widespread interest in multi-response regression analysis in many scientific applications, this article proposes a technique for data pre-smoothing in this setting based on low-rank approximation. We establish theoretical results on the performance of the proposed methodology, and quantify its benefit empirically in a number of simulated experiments. We also demonstrate our proposed low-rank pre-smoothing technique on real data arising from the environmental and biological sciences.</description>

      <title>Helvipad: A Real-World Dataset for Omnidirectional Stereo Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite considerable progress in stereo depth estimation, omnidirectional imaging remains underexplored, mainly due to the lack of appropriate data. We introduce Helvipad, a real-world dataset for omnidirectional stereo depth estimation, consisting of 40K frames from video sequences across diverse environments, including crowded indoor and outdoor scenes with diverse lighting conditions. Collected using two 360{\deg} cameras in a top-bottom setup and a LiDAR sensor, the dataset includes accurate depth and disparity labels by projecting 3D point clouds onto equirectangular images. Additionally, we provide an augmented training set with a significantly increased label density by using depth completion. We benchmark leading stereo depth estimation models for both standard and omnidirectional images. The results show that while recent stereo methods perform decently, a significant challenge persists in accurately estimating depth in omnidirectional imaging. To address this, we introduce necessary adaptations to stereo models, achieving improved performance.</description>

Abstract: We consider an initial-boundary value problem for the chemotaxis-Navier--Stokes system \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{c@{\quad}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c} n_{t}+u\cdot\nabla n=\nabla\cdot\big(D(n)\nabla n-nS(x,n,c)\cdot\nabla c\big),\ &amp;x\in\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ c_{t}+u\cdot\nabla c=\Delta c-cn,\ &amp;x\in\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ u_{t}+(u\cdot\nabla)u=\Delta u+\nabla P+n\nabla\Phi,\quad \nabla\cdot u=0,\ &amp;x\in\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ \big(D(n)\nabla n-nS(x,n,c)\cdot\nabla c)\cdot\nu=\nabla c\cdot\nu=0,\ u=0,\ &amp;x\in\partial\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ n(\cdot,0)=n_0,\ c(\cdot,0)=c_0,\ u(\cdot,0)=u_0,\ &amp;x\in\Omega. \end{array}\right. \end{align*} in a smoothly bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming $S:\overline{\Omega}\times[0,\infty)\times(0,\infty)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$ to be sufficiently regular and such that with $\gamma\in[0,\frac56]$ and some non-decreasing $S_0:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$, we have \begin{align*} \big|S(x,n,c)\big|\leq \frac{S_0(c)}{c^\gamma}\quad\text{for all }(x,n,c)\in\overline{\Omega}\times[0,\infty)\times(0,\infty), \end{align*} we show that if $D:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ is suitably regular and positive throughout $(0,\infty)$, then for all $M&gt;0$ one can find $L(M)&gt;0$ such that whenever $$\liminf_{n\to\infty} D(n)&gt;L\quad\text{and}\quad \liminf_{n\searrow0}\frac{D(n)}{n}&gt;0$$ are satisfied and the initial data $(n_0,c_0,u_0)$ are suitably regular and satisfy $\|c_0\|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}\leq M$ there is a global and bounded weak solution for the initial-boundary value problem above.

      <title>Can LLMs assist with Ambiguity? A Quantitative Evaluation of various Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Ising model on square-triangle tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square-triangle tilings to explore how the hyperuniformity, which characterizes long-range behavior of the point pattern, influences critical phenomena where long-range correlations play a crucial role. The square-triangle tilings are spatially random structures in two dimensions constructed by densely packing the plane with squares and triangles. The growth rule with a parameter $p$ proposed in our previous paper enables systematic generations of hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform tilings. Classical Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model on these tilings show that critical behavior always belongs to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. It is clarified that the critical temperature is higher for the tiling with higher regularity in terms of hyperuniformity. Critical phenomena in the Ising models on the periodic and quasiperiodic tilings composed of the square and triangle tiles are also addressed.</description>

      <title>PHOENIX -- Paderborn highly optimized and energy efficient solver for two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with integrated extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PHOENIX, a highly optimized explicit open-source solver for two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with extensions. The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and its extensions (Gross-Pitaevskii equation) are widely studied to model and analyze complex phenomena in fields such as optics, condensed matter physics, fluid dynamics, and plasma physics. It serves as a powerful tool for understanding nonlinear wave dynamics, soliton formation, and the interplay between nonlinearity, dispersion, and diffraction. By extending the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, various physical effects such as non-Hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and quantum optical aspects can be incorporated. PHOENIX is designed to accommodate a wide range of applications by a straightforward extendability without the need for user knowledge of computing architectures or performance optimization. The high performance and power efficiency of PHOENIX are demonstrated on a wide range of entry-class to high-end consumer and high-performance computing GPUs and CPUs. Compared to a more conventional MATLAB implementation, a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude and energy savings of up to 99.8% are achieved. The performance is compared to a performance model showing that PHOENIX performs close to the relevant performance bounds in many situations. The possibilities of PHOENIX are demonstrated with a range of practical examples from the realm of nonlinear (quantum) photonics in planar microresonators with active media including exciton-polariton condensates. Examples range from solutions on very large grids, the use of local optimization algorithms, to Monte Carlo ensemble evolutions with quantum noise enabling the tomography of the system's quantum state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin noise spectroscopy is a technique to measure magnetization fluctuations, a subject of increasing relevance in ultrafast spintronics. We investigate numerically the equilibrium spin noise of ferro- and antiferromagnets within an atomistic spin model. The aim is to predict the possible outcomes of ultrafast spin-noise spectroscopy measurements and demonstrate what relevant information can be extracted. Specifically, we show how this method can be used to determine phase transitions, frequencies of magnon modes and correlation times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized Federal learning(PFL) allows clients to cooperatively train a personalized model without disclosing their private dataset. However, PFL suffers from Non-IID, heterogeneous devices, lack of fairness, and unclear contribution which urgently need the interpretability of deep learning model to overcome these challenges. These challenges proposed new demands for interpretability. Low cost, privacy, and detailed information. There is no current interpretability method satisfying them. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability method \emph{FreqX} by introducing Signal Processing and Information Theory. Our experiments show that the explanation results of FreqX contain both attribution information and concept information. FreqX runs at least 10 times faster than the baselines which contain concept information.</description>

      <title>Entropy formula of folding type for $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, Ruelle derived explicit formulae for entropy production of smooth dynamical systems. The vanishing or strictly positivity of entropy production is determined by the entropy formula of folding type \[h_{\mu}(f)= F_{\mu}(f)-\displaystyle\int\sum\nolimits_{\lambda_i(f, x)&lt;0} \lambda_i(f, x)d\mu(x), \] which relates the metric entropy, folding entropy and negative Lyapunov exponents. This paper establishes the formula for all $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps, including those with degeneracy. More specifically, the entropy formula of folding type holds if and, under a condition on the Jacobian of the map, only if $\mu$ has absolutely continuous conditional measures on the stable manifolds. To overcome the degeneracy, the Pesin Theory for general $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps is developed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we constructed the supercharges and Hamiltonians for all variants of superconformal mechanics associated with the superalgebras $osp(8|2), F(4), osp(4^*|4)$, and $su(1,1|4)$. The fermionic and bosonic fields involved were arranged into generators spanning $so(8), so(7), so(5) \oplus su(2)$ and $su(4) \oplus u(1)$ $R$-symmetries of the corresponding superconformal algebras. The bosonic and fermionic parts of these $R$-symmetry generators separately define the constants of motion and form the same algebras. The angular part of the supercharges defining the system have the structure ``$(R-symmetry\; generators)\, \times\, fermions$'' while the angular part of Hamiltonian is just a proper sum of full Casimir operators and its purely bosonic and fermionic parts.</description>

      <title>First characterisation of the MAGO cavity, a superconducting RF detector for kHz-MHz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

      <title>TransferFuzz: Fuzzing with Historical Trace for Verifying Propagated Vulnerability Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code reuse in software development frequently facilitates the spread of vulnerabilities, making the scope of affected software in CVE reports imprecise. Traditional methods primarily focus on identifying reused vulnerability code within target software, yet they cannot verify if these vulnerabilities can be triggered in new software contexts. This limitation often results in false positives. In this paper, we introduce TransferFuzz, a novel vulnerability verification framework, to verify whether vulnerabilities propagated through code reuse can be triggered in new software. Innovatively, we collected runtime information during the execution or fuzzing of the basic binary (the vulnerable binary detailed in CVE reports). This process allowed us to extract historical traces, which proved instrumental in guiding the fuzzing process for the target binary (the new binary that reused the vulnerable function). TransferFuzz introduces a unique Key Bytes Guided Mutation strategy and a Nested Simulated Annealing algorithm, which transfers these historical traces to implement trace-guided fuzzing on the target binary, facilitating the accurate and efficient verification of the propagated vulnerability. Our evaluation, conducted on widely recognized datasets, shows that TransferFuzz can quickly validate vulnerabilities previously unverifiable with existing techniques. Its verification speed is 2.5 to 26.2 times faster than existing methods. Moreover, TransferFuzz has proven its effectiveness by expanding the impacted software scope for 15 vulnerabilities listed in CVE reports, increasing the number of affected binaries from 15 to 53. The datasets and source code used in this article are available at https://github.com/Siyuan-Li201/TransferFuzz.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>TryOffDiff: Virtual-Try-Off via High-Fidelity Garment Reconstruction using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF), a novel task focused on generating standardized garment images from single photos of clothed individuals. Unlike traditional Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF aims to extract a canonical garment image, posing unique challenges in capturing garment shape, texture, and intricate patterns. This well-defined target makes VTOFF particularly effective for evaluating reconstruction fidelity in generative models. We present TryOffDiff, a model that adapts Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to ensure high fidelity and detail retention. Experiments on a modified VITON-HD dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods based on pose transfer and virtual try-on with fewer pre- and post-processing steps. Our analysis reveals that traditional image generation metrics inadequately assess reconstruction quality, prompting us to rely on DISTS for more accurate evaluation. Our results highlight the potential of VTOFF to enhance product imagery in e-commerce applications, advance generative model evaluation, and inspire future work on high-fidelity reconstruction.

      <description>arXiv:2411.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-known issue that in Item Response Theory models there is no closed-form for the maximum likelihood estimators of the item parameters. Parameter estimation is therefore typically achieved by means of numerical methods like gradient search. The present work has a two-fold aim: On the one hand, we revise the fundamental notions associated to the item parameter estimation in 2 parameter Item Response Theory models from the perspective of the complete-data likelihood. On the other hand, we argue that, within an Expectation-Maximization approach, a closed-form for discrimination and difficulty parameters can actually be obtained that simply corresponds to the Ordinary Least Square solution.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scale factor Duality Symmetry in Symmetric Teleparallel Scalar-tensor FLRW Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry for the dilaton field in scalar-tensor theory and its extension in teleparallelism. Within the framework of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker metric cosmology. For the three possible connections, we write the corresponding point-like Lagrangians for the gravitational field equations, and we construct discrete transformations which generalize the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry. The discrete transformations depend on the parameter which defines the coupling between the scalar field and the nonmetricity scalar. The Gasperini-Veneziano duality symmetry is recovered for a specific limit of this free parameter. Furthermore, we derive the conservation laws for the classical field equations for these models, and we present the origin of the discrete transformations. Finally, we discuss the integrability properties of the model, and exact solutions are determined.</description>

      <title>A universal approach to Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for computing the Renyi entropy with general multiple disjoint intervals from the swapping operations. Our theory is proposed based on the fact that we have observed the resemblance between the replica trick in quantum field theory and the swapping operation. Consequently, the Renyi entropy can be obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the swapping operator. As an application, we study the Renyi entropy of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model for two, three and four disjoint intervals. As the system is at the critical point, our computations of the Renyi entropy are consistent with the analytical results from the conformal field theory. Moreover, our methods can go beyond the critical regime of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Optimising Iteration Scheduling for Full-State Vector Simulation of Quantum Circuits on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of quantum computing grows, novel algorithms which take advantage of quantum phenomena need to be developed. As we are currently in the NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) era, quantum algorithm researchers cannot reliably test their algorithms on real quantum hardware, which is still too limited. Instead, quantum computing simulators on classical computing systems are used. In the quantum circuit model, quantum bits (qubits) are operated on by quantum gates. A quantum circuit is a sequence of such quantum gates operating on some number of qubits. A quantum gate applied to a qubit can be controlled by other qubits in the circuit. This applies the gate only to the states which satisfy the required control qubit state. We particularly target FPGAs as our main simulation platform, as these offer potential energy savings when compared to running simulations on CPUs/GPUs.
  In this work, we present a memory access pattern to optimise the number of iterations that need to be scheduled to execute a quantum gate such that only the iterations which access the required pairs (determined according to the control qubits imposed on the gate) are scheduled. We show that this approach results in a significant reduction in the time required to simulate a gate for each added control qubit. We also show that this approach benefits the simulation time on FPGAs more than CPUs and GPUs and allows to outperform both CPU and GPU platforms in terms of energy efficiency, which is the main factor for scalability of the simulations.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate Vortices with Hypercylindrical Symmetry using Zeroth-order Dimensional Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate D-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a hypercylindrical trap with a vortex core along the z-axis and quantized circulation $\hbar m$. We analytically approximate the hypercylindrical Gross-Pitaevskii equation using dimensional perturbation theory, where the perturbation parameter is $\delta=1/(D+2|m|-3)$. We analyze lower effective dimensions due to trap anisotropy, and we compute properties of vortices in higher dimensions motivated by the study of synthetic dimensions, where additional dimensions can be simulated experimentally, and by holographic duality, where a higher-dimensional gravitational model corresponds to a lower-dimensional quantum model. We derive zeroth-order ($\delta \to 0$) semiclassical approximations for the condensate density, energy, chemical potential, and critical vortex rotation speed in arbitrary dimensions. In the zeroth-order approximation, we observe crossings between energy levels for different dimensions as a function of interaction strength and anisotropy parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local (in time) existence and uniqueness for a class of infinite-dimensional Nash systems, namely systems of infinitely many Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations set in an infinite-dimensional Euclidean space. Such systems have been recently showed (see arXiv:2401.06534) to arise in the theory of stochastic differential games with interactions governed by sparse graphs, under structural assumptions that inspired the hypotheses exploited in the present work. Contextually, we also prove a general linear result, providing a priori estimates, stable with respect to the dimension, for transport-diffusion equations whose drifts (and their derivatives) enjoy appropriate decay properties.</description>

      <title>Atoms in Dense Plasmas: Models, Applications, and Current Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling plasmas in terms of atoms or ions is theoretically appealing for several reasons. When it is relevant, the notion of atom or ion in a plasma provides us with an interpretation scheme of the plasma's microscopic structure. From the standpoint of quantitative estimation of plasma properties, atomic models of plasma allow extending many theoretical tools of atomic physics to plasmas. This notably includes the statistical approaches to the detailed accounting for excited states, or the collisional-radiative modeling of non-equilibrium plasmas, which is based on the notion of atomic processes.
  This habilitation thesis is mostly focused on the studies to which the author has contributed in the field of atomic modeling of dense, non-ideal plasmas. The studies to which the author contributed in the field of collisional-radiative modeling of non-LTE plasmas are also addressed, and the prospect of bridging with dense-plasma models is sketched.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of a heat flux closure for electrostatic plasma phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in understanding multi-scale collisionless plasma phenomena requires employing tools which balance computational efficiency and physics fidelity. Collisionless fluid models are able to resolve spatio-temporal scales that are unfeasible with fully kinetic models. However, constructing such models requires truncating the infinite hierarchy of moment equations and supplying an appropriate closure to approximate the unresolved physics. Data-driven methods have recently begun to see increased application to this end, enabling a systematic approach to constructing closures. Here, we utilise sparse regression to search for heat flux closures for one-dimensional electrostatic plasma phenomena. We examine OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulation data of Landau-damped Langmuir waves and two-stream instabilities. Sparse regression consistently identifies six terms as physically relevant, together regularly accounting for more than 95% of the variation in the heat flux. We further quantify the relative importance of these terms under various circumstances and examine their dependence on parameters such as thermal speed and growth/damping rate. The results are discussed in the context of previously known collisionless closures and linear collisionless theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a large system of $N$ Brownian motions in $\R ^d$ fixed on a time interval $[0,\beta]$ with symmetrized initial and terminal conditions, under the influence of a trap potential. Such systems describe systems of bosons at positive temperatures confined in a spatial domain. We describe the large $N$ behavior of the averaged path (that is, their empirical path measure) and its connection with a well known optimal transport problem formulated by Erwin Schr\"odinger. We also explore the asymptotic behavior of the Brownian motions in terms of Large Deviations. In particular, the rate function that governs the mean of occupation measures turns out to be the well-known Donsker-Varadhan rate function. We therefore prove a simple formula for the large $N$ asymptotic of the symmetrized trace of $e^{-\beta \Hcal_N}$, where $\Hcal_N$ is an $N$ particle Hamilton operator in a trap</description>

      <title>Linearizations of periodic point free distal homeomorphisms on the annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{A}$ be an annulus in the plane $\mathbb R^2$ and $g:\mathbb{A}\rightarrow \mathbb{A}$ be a boundary components preserving homeomorphism which is distal and has no periodic points. In \cite{SXY}, the authors show that there is a continuous decomposition $\mathcal P$ of $\mathbb{A}$ into $g$-invariant circles such that all the restrictions of $g$ on them share a common irrational rotation number (also called the rotation number of $g$) and all these circles are linearly ordered by the inclusion relation on the sets of bounded components of their complements in $\mathbb R^2$. In this note, we show that if the decomposition $\mathcal P$ above has a continuous section, then $g$ can be linearized, that is it is topologically conjugate to a rigid rotation on $\mathbb{A}$. For every irrational number $\alpha\in (0, 1)$, we show the existence of such a distal homeomorphism $g$ on $\mathbb{A}$ that it cannot be linearized and its rotation number is $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Validated matrix multiplication transform for orthogonal polynomials with applications to computer-assisted proofs for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we achieve three primary objectives related to the rigorous computational analysis of nonlinear PDEs posed on complex geometries such as disks and cylinders. First, we introduce a validated Matrix Multiplication Transform (MMT) algorithm, analogous to the discrete Fourier transform, which offers a reliable framework for evaluating nonlinearities in spectral methods while effectively mitigating challenges associated with rounding errors. Second, we examine the Zernike polynomials, a spectral basis well-suited for problems on the disk, and highlight their essential properties. We further demonstrate how the MMT approach can be effectively employed to compute the product of truncated Zernike series, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we combine the MMT framework and Zernike series to construct computer-assisted proofs that establish the existence of solutions to two distinct nonlinear elliptic PDEs on the disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new explicit connections between classical (scalar) and matrix Gegenbauer polynomials, which result in new symmetries of the latter and further give access to several properties that have been out of reach before: generating functions, distribution of zeros for individual entries of the matrices and new type of differential-difference structure. We further speculate about other potentials of the connection formulas found. Part of our proofs makes use of creative telescoping in a matrix setting$-$the strategy which is not yet developed algorithmically.</description>

      <title>ChatRex: Taming Multimodal LLM for Joint Perception and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception and understanding are two pillars of computer vision. While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After standard two-stage training, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception capabilities while preserving multimodal understanding performance. The combination of these two capabilities simultaneously unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating the complementary roles of both perception and understanding in MLLM. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/ChatRex}.</description>

      <title>Linear Extensions of Rotor-Routing in Directed Graphs: Reachability Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a linear extension of the rotor-routing model in directed graphs, akin to the sandpile model and vector addition systems, together with new rotor mechanisms that extend standard cyclic rotors. In this framework, rotor-routing is interpreted as the simultaneous movement of particles accross two coupled graphs, involving both vertex and arc-based particles. The standard, combinatorial rotor-routing of positive particles (legal routing) based on rotor-configurations, then becomes a special case of a linear equivalence. We give comprehensive reachability results characterizing legal routings among linear equivalences, expanding on previous results, and settle the algorithmic complexities associated with these problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently several large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability to generate a message in response to a user request. Such scientific breakthroughs promote new perspectives but also some fears. The main focus of this study is to analyze the written style of one LLM called ChatGPT 3.5 by comparing its generated messages with those of the recent US presidents. To achieve this objective, we compare the State of the Union addresses written by Reagan to Obama with those automatically produced by ChatGPT. We found that ChatGPT tends to overuse the lemma "we" as well as nouns and commas. On the other hand, the generated speeches employ less verbs and include, in mean, longer sentences. Even when imposing a given style to ChatGPT, the resulting speech remains distinct from messages written by the target author. Moreover, ChatGPT opts for a neutral tone with mainly positive emotional expressions and symbolic terms (e.g., freedom, nation). Finally, we show that the GPT's style exposes distinct features compared to real presidential addresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain upper bounds on the number of irreducible factors of some classes of polynomials having integer coefficients, which in particular yield some of the well known irreducibility criteria. For devising our results, we use the information about prime factorization of the values taken by such polynomials at sufficiently large integer arguments along with the information about their root location in the complex plane. Further, these techniques are extended to bivariate polynomials over arbitrary fields using non-Archimedean absolute values, yielding extensions of the irreducibility results of M. Ram Murty and S. Weintraub to bivariate polynomials.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Fair Many-to-One Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bipartite graph $G=(U\cup V,E)$, a left-perfect many-to-one matching is a subset $M \subseteq E$ such that each vertex in $U$ is incident with exactly one edge in $M$. If $U$ is partitioned into some groups, the matching is called fair if for every $v\in V$, the difference between the number of vertices matched with $v$ in any two groups does not exceed a given threshold. In this paper, we investigate parameterized complexity of fair left-perfect many-to-one matching problem with respect to the structural parameters of the input graph. In particular, we prove that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to the feedback vertex number, tree-depth and the maximum degree of $U$, combined. Also, it is W[1]-hard with respect to the path-width, the number of groups and the maximum degree of $U$, combined. In the positive side, we prove that the problem is FPT with respect to the treewidth and the maximum degree of $V$. Also, it is FPT with respect to the neighborhood diversity of the input graph (which implies being FPT with respect to vertex cover and modular-width). Finally, we prove that the problem is FPT with respect to the tree-depth and the number of groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous or conversational multilingual speech presents many challenges for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this work, we present a new technique AMPS that augments a multilingual multimodal ASR system with paraphrase-based supervision for improved conversational ASR in multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, and Nyanja. We use paraphrases of the reference transcriptions as additional supervision while training the multimodal ASR model and selectively invoke this paraphrase objective for utterances with poor ASR performance. Using AMPS with a state-of-the-art multimodal model SeamlessM4T, we obtain significant relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) of up to 5%.

      <title>G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>A one-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we introduce a simple and scalable post processing which allows us to formulate a generic semi-analytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies here discussed will become increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Accurate electron correlation-energy functional: Expansion in an interaction renormalized by the random-phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accurate local density-functional for electronic-structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT). The functional is derived by analyzing the structure of the standard perturbative expansion of the correlation energy of the interacting uniform electron gas. Then, the expansion is partially re-summed and reorganized as a self-consistent series in powers of a renormalized electron-electron interaction vertex based on the screened frequency-momentum dependent dielectric matrix given by the well-known random-phase approximation. First, we demonstrate that the range of $r_s$, where this reorganized and renormalized series converges, contains and is significantly larger than the average range realized in real crystalline materials. Using a combination of analytical, numerical, and stochastic integration techniques we are able to calculate all the diagrams which have contribution up to the same leading order. We benchmarked the functional using the Quantum ESPRESSO implementation of the DFT applied to the same list of materials, selected previously by other authors, in its entirety without any modification of the list. We find that for ground-state properties in general, such as, equilibrium atomic distances and bulk moduli, the functional presented here is more accurate than the currently available most popular one.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-driven Sampling for Efficient Pairwise Comparison Subjective Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing image quality is crucial in image processing tasks such as compression, super-resolution, and denoising. While subjective assessments involving human evaluators provide the most accurate quality scores, they are impractical for large-scale or continuous evaluations due to their high cost and time requirements. Pairwise comparison subjective assessment tests, which rank image pairs instead of assigning scores, offer more reliability and accuracy but require numerous comparisons, leading to high costs. Although objective quality metrics are more efficient, they lack the precision of subjective tests, which are essential for benchmarking and training learning-based quality metrics. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based sampling method to optimize the pairwise comparison subjective assessment process. By utilizing deep learning models to estimate human preferences and identify pairs that need human labeling, the approach reduces the number of required comparisons while maintaining high accuracy. The key contributions include modeling uncertainty for accurate preference predictions and for pairwise sampling. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional active sampling methods.

      <title>Vacuum Polarization Energy of a Proca Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extended Proca model with one scalar field and one massive vector field in one space and one time dimensions. We construct the soliton solution and subsequently compute the vacuum polarization energy (VPE) which is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of the soliton. For this calculation we adopt the spectral methods approach which heavily relies on the analytic properties of the Jost function. This function is extracted from the interaction of the quantum fluctuations with a background potential generated by the soliton. Particularly we explore eventual non-analytical components that may be induced by mass gaps and the unconventional normalization for the longitudinal component of the vector field fluctuations. By numerical simulation we verify that these obstacles do actually not arise and that the real and imaginary momentum formulations of the VPE yield equal results. The Born approximation to the Jost function is crucial when implementing standard renormalization conditions. In this context we solve problems arising from the Born approximation being imaginary for real momenta associated with energies in the mass gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give excursion theoretical proofs of Lehoczky's formula (in an extended form allowing a lower bound for the underlying diffusion) for the joint distribution of the first drawdown time and the maximum before this time, and of Malyutin's formula for the joint distribution of the first hitting time and the maximum drawdown before this time. It is remarkable -- but there is a clean explanation -- that the excursion theoretical approach which we developed first for Lehoczky's formula provides also a proof for Malyutin's formula. Moreover, we discuss some generalizations and analyze the pure jump process describing the maximum before the first drawdown time when the size of the drawdown is varying</description>

      <title>Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying the video diffusion model (VDM) in practical applications. To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} e.g., coherence of the entire video, while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} e.g., individual frames. Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Additionally, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM, i.e., the teacher to VDMini i.e., the student. Particularly, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to ensure consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$ and 1.4 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V and the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on two benchmarks, i.e., UCF101 and VBench.</description>

      <title>Preserving Deep Representations In One-Shot Pruning: A Hessian-Free Second-Order Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SNOWS, a one-shot post-training pruning framework aimed at reducing the cost of vision network inference without retraining. Current leading one-shot pruning methods minimize layer-wise least squares reconstruction error which does not take into account deeper network representations. We propose to optimize a more global reconstruction objective. This objective accounts for nonlinear activations deep in the network to obtain a better proxy for the network loss. This nonlinear objective leads to a more challenging optimization problem -- we demonstrate it can be solved efficiently using a specialized second-order optimization framework. A key innovation of our framework is the use of Hessian-free optimization to compute exact Newton descent steps without needing to compute or store the full Hessian matrix. A distinct advantage of SNOWS is that it can be readily applied on top of any sparse mask derived from prior methods, readjusting their weights to exploit nonlinearities in deep feature representations. SNOWS obtains state-of-the-art results on various one-shot pruning benchmarks including residual networks and Vision Transformers (ViT/B-16 and ViT/L-16, 86m and 304m parameters respectively).</description>

      <title>XR-MBT: Multi-modal Full Body Tracking for XR through Self-Supervision with Learned Depth Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the full body motions of users in XR (AR/VR) devices is a fundamental challenge to bring a sense of authentic social presence. Due to the absence of dedicated leg sensors, currently available body tracking methods adopt a synthesis approach to generate plausible motions given a 3-point signal from the head and controller tracking. In order to enable mixed reality features, modern XR devices are capable of estimating depth information of the headset surroundings using available sensors combined with dedicated machine learning models. Such egocentric depth sensing cannot drive the body directly, as it is not registered and is incomplete due to limited field-of-view and body self-occlusions. For the first time, we propose to leverage the available depth sensing signal combined with self-supervision to learn a multi-modal pose estimation model capable of tracking full body motions in real time on XR devices. We demonstrate how current 3-point motion synthesis models can be extended to point cloud modalities using a semantic point cloud encoder network combined with a residual network for multi-modal pose estimation. These modules are trained jointly in a self-supervised way, leveraging a combination of real unregistered point clouds and simulated data obtained from motion capture. We compare our approach against several state-of-the-art systems for XR body tracking and show that our method accurately tracks a diverse range of body motions. XR-MBT tracks legs in XR for the first time, whereas traditional synthesis approaches based on partial body tracking are blind.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Electromagnetic radiation with an angular frequency equal to half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Progress on the spectroscopy of an Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to matter in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report progress on our lattice calculations for the mass spectra of low-lying composite states in the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to two and three flavors of Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental and the two-index antisymmetric representations, respectively. This theory provides an ultraviolet completion to the composite Higgs model with Goldstone modes in the SU(4)/Sp(4) coset and with partial compositeness for generating the top-quark mass. We measure the meson and chimera baryon masses. These masses are crucial for constructing the composite Higgs model. In particular, the chimera baryon masses are important inputs for implementing top partial compositeness. We employ Wilson fermions and the Wilson plaquette action in our simulations. Techniques such as APE and Wuppertal smearing, as well as the procedure of generalised eigenvalue problem, are implemented in our analysis.</description>

      <title>SoK: Privacy Personalised -- Mapping Personal Attributes \&amp; Preferences of Privacy Mechanisms for Shoulder Surfing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shoulder surfing is a byproduct of smartphone use that enables bystanders to access personal information (such as text and photos) by making screen observations without consent. To mitigate this, several protection mechanisms have been proposed to protect user privacy. However, the mechanisms that users prefer remain unexplored. This paper explores correlations between personal attributes and properties of shoulder surfing protection mechanisms. For this, we first conducted a structured literature review and identified ten protection mechanism categories against content-based shoulder surfing. We then surveyed N=192 users and explored correlations between personal attributes and properties of shoulder surfing protection mechanisms. Our results show that users agreed that the presented mechanisms assisted in protecting their privacy, but they preferred non-digital alternatives. Among the mechanisms, participants mainly preferred an icon overlay mechanism followed by a tangible mechanism. We also found that users who prioritized out-of-device privacy and a high tendency to interact with technology favoured the personalisation of protection mechanisms. On the contrary, age and smartphone OS did not impact users' preference for perceived usefulness and personalisation of mechanisms. Based on the results, we present key takeaways to support the design of future protection mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Flow Shop Scheduling with Inter-Stage Flexibility and Blocking Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a scheduling problem arising from a material handling and processing problem in a production line of an Austrian company building prefabricated house walls. The addressed problem is a permutation flow shop with blocking constraints in which the machine of at least one stage can process a number operations of two other stages in the system. This situation is usually referred to as multi-task or inter-stage flexibility. The problem is in general NP-hard, but we derive a number of special cases that can be solved in polynomial time. For the general case, we present a variety of heuristic algorithms, with a focus on matheuristics that are grounded in two different mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulations of the problem. These matheuristics leverage the strengths of exact optimization techniques while introducing flexibility to address limits on computation time. To assess the performance of the proposed approaches, we conduct an extensive computational study on randomly generated test cases based on real-world instances.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT as speechwriter for the French presidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI proposes several large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a message in response to users' requests. Such scientific breakthroughs promote new writing assistants but with some fears. The main focus of this study is to analyze the written style of one LLM called ChatGPT by comparing its generated messages with those of the recent French presidents. To achieve this, we compare end-of-the-year addresses written by Chirac, Sarkozy, Hollande, and Macron with those automatically produced by ChatGPT. We found that ChatGPT tends to overuse nouns, possessive determiners, and numbers. On the other hand, the generated speeches employ less verbs, pronouns, and adverbs and include, in mean, too standardized sentences. Considering some words, one can observe that ChatGPT tends to overuse "to must" (devoir), "to continue" or the lemma "we" (nous). Moreover, GPT underuses the auxiliary verb "to be" (^etre), or the modal verbs "to will" (vouloir) or "to have to" (falloir). In addition, when a short text is provided as example to ChatGPT, the machine can generate a short message with a style closed to the original wording. Finally, we reveal that ChatGPT style exposes distinct features compared to real presidential speeches.</description>

Abstract: Thirteen years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, Japan's nuclear energy accounts for only approximately 6% of electricity production, as most nuclear plants remain shut down. To revitalize the nuclear industry and achieve sustainable development goals, effective communication with Japanese citizens, grounded in an accurate understanding of public sentiment, is of paramount importance. While nationwide surveys have traditionally been used to gauge public views, the rise of social media in recent years has provided a promising new avenue for understanding public sentiment. To explore domestic sentiment on nuclear energy-related issues expressed online, we analyzed the content and comments of over 3,000 YouTube videos covering topics related to nuclear energy. Topic modeling was used to extract the main topics from the videos, and sentiment analysis with large language models classified user sentiments towards each topic. Additionally, word co-occurrence network analysis was performed to examine the shift in online discussions during August and September 2023 regarding the release of treated water. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the online discourse on nuclear energy and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of public sentiment in Japan.</description>

      <title>Optimal In-Network Distribution of Learning Functions for a Secure-by-Design Programmable Data Plane of Next-Generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of programmable data plane (PDP) and in-network computing (INC) paradigms paves the way for the development of network devices (switches, network interface cards, etc.) capable of performing advanced computing tasks. This allows to execute algorithms of various nature, including machine learning ones, within the network itself to support user and network services. In particular, this paper delves into the issue of implementing in-network learning models to support distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS). It proposes a model that optimally distributes the IDS workload, resulting from the subdivision of a "Strong Learner" (SL) model into lighter distributed "Weak Learner" (WL) models, among data plane devices; the objective is to ensure complete network security without excessively burdening their normal operations. Furthermore, a meta-heuristic approach is proposed to reduce the long computational time required by the exact solution provided by the mathematical model, and its performance is evaluated. The analysis conducted and the results obtained demonstrate the enormous potential of the proposed new approach to the creation of intelligent data planes that effectively act as a first line of defense against cyber attacks, with minimal additional workload on network devices.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Uncertainty and Personalization via Efficient Second-order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising method to collaboratively learn from decentralized and heterogeneous data available at different clients without the requirement of data ever leaving the clients. Recent works on FL have advocated taking a Bayesian approach to FL as it offers a principled way to account for the model and predictive uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution for the client and/or server models. Moreover, Bayesian FL also naturally enables personalization in FL to handle data heterogeneity across the different clients by having each client learn its own distinct personalized model. In particular, the hierarchical Bayesian approach enables all the clients to learn their personalized models while also taking into account the commonalities via a prior distribution provided by the server. However, despite their promise, Bayesian approaches for FL can be computationally expensive and can have high communication costs as well because of the requirement of computing and sending the posterior distributions. We present a novel Bayesian FL method using an efficient second-order optimization approach, with a computational cost that is similar to first-order optimization methods like Adam, but also provides the various benefits of the Bayesian approach for FL (e.g., uncertainty, personalization), while also being significantly more efficient and accurate than SOTA Bayesian FL methods (both for standard as well as personalized FL settings). Our method achieves improved predictive accuracies as well as better uncertainty estimates as compared to the baselines which include both optimization based as well as Bayesian FL methods.</description>

      <title>Near-field acoustic imaging with a caged bubble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles are ubiquitous in many research applications ranging from ultrasound imaging and drug delivery to the understanding of volcanic eruptions and water circulation in vascular plants. From an acoustic perspective, bubbles are resonant scatterers with remarkable properties, including a large scattering cross-section and strongly sub-wavelength dimensions. While it is known that the resonance properties of bubbles depend on their local environment, it remains challenging to probe this interaction at the single-bubble level due to the difficulty of manipulating a single resonating bubble in a liquid. Here, we confine a cubic bubble inside a cage using 3D printing technology, and we use this bubble as a local probe to perform scanning near-field acoustic microscopy -- an acoustic analogue of scanning near-field optical microscopy. By probing the acoustic interaction between a single resonating bubble and its local environment, we demonstrate near-field imaging of complex structures with a resolution that is two orders of magnitudes smaller than the wavelength of the acoustic field. As a potential application, our approach paves the way for the development of low-cost acoustic microscopes based on caged bubbles.</description>

      <title>A Novel Kinesthetic Haptic Feedback Device Driven by Soft Electrohydraulic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing kinesthetic haptic devices with advanced haptic rendering capabilities is challenging due to the limitations on driving mechanisms. In this study, we introduce a novel soft electrohydraulic actuator and develop a kinesthetic haptic device utilizing it as the driving unit. We established a mathematical model and conducted testing experiments to demonstrate the device's ability to stably output controllable feedback force. Our experiments also demonstrates that this device exhibits fast response characteristics. By utilizing the easily controllable nature of the soft electrohydraulic actuator, we were able to achieve high-resolution controllable feedback force output. Furthermore, by modulating the waveform of the driving high voltage, the device acquired the capability to render variable frequency haptic vibration without adding any extra vibration actuator. Using this kinesthetic haptic device, we built a teleoperated robotic system, showcasing the device's potential application as a haptic force feedback system in the field of robotics.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks Do Work with Pre-Defined Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel class of Convolutional Neural Networks called Pre-defined Filter Convolutional Neural Networks (PFCNNs), where all nxn convolution kernels with n&gt;1 are pre-defined and constant during training. It involves a special form of depthwise convolution operation called a Pre-defined Filter Module (PFM). In the channel-wise convolution part, the 1xnxn kernels are drawn from a fixed pool of only a few (16) different pre-defined kernels. In the 1x1 convolution part linear combinations of the pre-defined filter outputs are learned. Despite this harsh restriction, complex and discriminative features are learned. These findings provide a novel perspective on the way how information is processed within deep CNNs. We discuss various properties of PFCNNs and prove their effectiveness using the popular datasets Caltech101, CIFAR10, CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, Flowers102, and Stanford Cars. Our implementation of PFCNNs is provided on Github https://github.com/Criscraft/PredefinedFilterNetworks</description>

      <title>On norming systems of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of linear equations $L$ is said to be norming if a natural functional $t_L(\cdot)$ giving a weighted count for the set of solutions to the system can be used to define a norm on the space of real-valued functions on $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ for every $n&gt;0$. For example, Gowers uniformity norms arise in this way. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of norming linear systems by proving a range of necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be norming. Some highlights include an isomorphism theorem for the functional $t_L(\cdot)$, a proof that any norming system must be variable-transitive and the classification of all norming systems of rank at most two.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-finite modules and weight modules I: weighting functors, almost-coherent families and category $\mathfrak{A}^{\text{irr}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds upon J. Nilsson's classification of rank one $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-free modules by extending the analysis to modules without rank restrictions, focusing on the category $\mathfrak{A}$ of $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-finite $\mathfrak{g}$-modules. A deeper investigation of the weighting functor $\mathcal{W}$ and its left derived functors, $\mathcal{W}_*$, led to the proof that simple $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-finite modules of infinite dimension are $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-torsion free. Furthermore, it is shown that these modules are $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-free if they possess non-integral or singular central characters. It is concluded that the existence of $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-torsion-free $\mathfrak{g}$-modules is restricted to Lie algebras of types A and C.
  The concept of an almost-coherent family, which generalizes O. Mathieu's definition of coherent families, is introduced. It is proved that $\mathcal{W}(M)$, for a $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-torsion-free module $M$, falls within this class of weight modules. Furthermore, a notion of almost-equivalence is defined to establish a connection between irreducible semi-simple almost-coherent families and O. Mathieu's original classification.
  Progress is also made in classifying simple modules within the category $\mathfrak{A}^{\text{irr}}$, which consists of $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-finite modules $M$ with the property that $\mathcal{W}(M)$ is an irreducible almost-coherent family. A complete classification is achieved for type C, with partial classification for type A. Finally, a conjecture is presented asserting that all simple $\mathfrak{sl}(n+1)$-modules in $\mathfrak{A}^{\text{irr}}$ are isomorphic to simple subquotients of exponential tensor modules, and supporting results are proved.</description>

      <title>GeneQuery: A General QA-based Framework for Spatial Gene Expression Predictions from Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression profiling provides profound insights into molecular mechanisms, but its time-consuming and costly nature often presents significant challenges. In contrast, whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained histological images are readily accessible and allow for detailed examinations of tissue structure and composition at the microscopic level. Recent advancements have utilized these histological images to predict spatially resolved gene expression profiles. However, state-of-the-art works treat gene expression prediction as a multi-output regression problem, where each gene is learned independently with its own weights, failing to capture the shared dependencies and co-expression patterns between genes. Besides, existing works can only predict gene expression values for genes seen during training, limiting their ability to generalize to new, unseen genes.
  To address the above limitations, this paper presents GeneQuery, which aims to solve this gene expression prediction task in a question-answering (QA) manner for better generality and flexibility. Specifically, GeneQuery takes gene-related texts as queries and whole-slide images as contexts and then predicts the queried gene expression values. With such a transformation, GeneQuery can implicitly estimate the gene distribution by introducing the gene random variable. Besides, the proposed GeneQuery consists of two architecture implementations, i.e., spot-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between images and gene-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between genes. Comprehensive experiments on spatial transcriptomics datasets show that the proposed GeneQuery outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on known and unseen genes. More results also demonstrate that GeneQuery can potentially analyze the tissue structure.</description>

      <title>The more, the better? Evaluating the role of EEG preprocessing for deep learning applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed a notable surge in deep learning applications for the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data, thanks to its demonstrated superiority over conventional statistical techniques. However, even deep learning models can underperform if trained with bad processed data. While preprocessing is essential to the analysis of EEG data, there is a need of research examining its precise impact on model performance. This causes uncertainty about whether and to what extent EEG data should be preprocessed in a deep learning scenario. This study aims at investigating the role of EEG preprocessing in deep learning applications, drafting guidelines for future research. It evaluates the impact of different levels of preprocessing, from raw and minimally filtered data to complex pipelines with automated artifact removal algorithms. Six classification tasks (eye blinking, motor imagery, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, sleep deprivation, and first episode psychosis) and four different architectures commonly used in the EEG domain were considered for the evaluation. The analysis of 4800 different trainings revealed statistical differences between the preprocessing pipelines at the intra-task level, for each of the investigated models, and at the inter-task level, for the largest one. Raw data generally leads to underperforming models, always ranking last in averaged score. In addition, models seem to benefit more from minimal pipelines without artifact handling methods, suggesting that EEG artifacts may contribute to the performance of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Rewards on Developers' Proactive AI Accountability Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems offers benefits for various domains of the economy and society but simultaneously raises concerns due to emerging scandals. These scandals have led to the increasing importance of AI accountability to ensure that actors provide justification and victims receive compensation. However, AI accountability has a negative connotation due to its emphasis on penalizing sanctions, resulting in reactive approaches to emerging concerns. To counteract the prevalent negative view and offer a proactive approach to facilitate the AI accountability behavior of developers, we explore rewards as an alternative mechanism to sanctions. We develop a theoretical model grounded in Self-Determination Theory to uncover the potential impact of rewards and sanctions on AI developers. We further identify typical sanctions and bug bounties as potential reward mechanisms by surveying related research from various domains, including cybersecurity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the excited states $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) is investigated in the dissociation of $^{12}$C $\to$ 3$\alpha$ and $^{16}$O $\to$ 4$\alpha$ at the energy of 3.65 GeV per nucleon in the nuclear emulsion. The identification becomes possible by reconstructing the invariant mass from measurements of emission angles in the approximation of conservation of momentum per nucleon of the parent nucleus. The contribution of the decays $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) to the dissociation $^{12}$C $\to$ 3$\alpha$ is 11 and 19%, and in $^{16}$O $\to$ 4$\alpha$ it is - 20 and 30%, correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling of the superfluid-supersolid transition in an elongated dipolar gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation, in comparison to the adiabatic case. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both, the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a minisuperspace of complex deformations of ABJM theory for which the partition function specifies the amplitude of an eternally inflating universe. The boundary theory predicts that the bosonic bulk is effectively in the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary state, with a subleading 'tunneling' contribution. This holographic model of inflation also reveals a close connection between the swampland distance and cobordism conjectures, and the condition for the asymptotic wave function to predict classical behavior in geometry and fields.</description>

      <title>Optimal payoff under Bregman-Wasserstein divergence constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal payoff choice for an expected utility maximizer under the constraint that their payoff is not allowed to deviate ``too much'' from a given benchmark. We solve this problem when the deviation is assessed via a Bregman-Wasserstein (BW) divergence, generated by a convex function $\phi$. Unlike the Wasserstein distance (i.e., when $\phi(x)=x^2$). The inherent asymmetry of the BW divergence makes it possible to penalize positive deviations different than negative ones. As a main contribution, we provide the optimal payoff in this setting. Numerical examples illustrate that the choice of $\phi$ allow to better align the payoff choice with the objectives of investors.</description>

      <title>Derivative Estimation of Multivariate Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches for derivative estimation are restricted to univariate functional data. We propose two methods to estimate the principal components and scores for the derivatives of multivariate functional data. As a result, the derivatives can be reconstructed by a multivariate Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion. The first approach is an extended version of multivariate functional principal component analysis (MFPCA) which incorporates the derivatives, referred to as derivative MFPCA (DMFPCA). The second approach is based on the derivation of multivariate Karhunen-Lo\`eve (DMKL) expansion. We compare the performance of the two proposed methods with a direct approach in simulations. The simulation results indicate that DMFPCA outperforms DMKL and the direct approach, particularly for densely observed data. We apply DMFPCA and DMKL methods to coronary angiogram data to recover derivatives of diameter and quantitative flow ratio. We obtain the multivariate functional principal components and scores of the derivatives, which can be used to classify patterns of coronary artery disease.</description>

      <title>De-baryonifying halos via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback uncertainty is a limiting systematic for next-generation weak gravitational lensing analyses. At the same time, high-resolution weak lensing maps are best analyzed at the field-level. Thus, robustly accounting for the baryonic effects in the projected matter density field is required. Ideally, constraints on feedback strength from astrophysical probes should be folded into the weak lensing field-level likelihood. We propose a macroscopic method based on an empirical correlation between feedback strength and an optimal transport cost. Since feedback is local re-distribution of matter, optimal transport is a promising concept. In this proof-of-concept, we de-baryonify projected mass around individual halos in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We choose the de-baryonified solution as the point of maximum likelihood on the hypersurface defined by fixed optimal transport cost around the observed full-physics halos. The likelihood is approximated through a normalizing flow trained on multiple gravity-only simulations. We find that the set of de-baryonified halos reproduces the correct convergence power spectrum suppression. There is considerable scatter when considering individual halos. We outline how the optimal transport de-baryonification concept can be generalized to full convergence maps.</description>

      <title>Implications on CP violation of charmless three body decays of bottom baryon from the U-spin analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent LHCb measurements of CP violation in $\Lambda_b$ three-body decays, we conduct an analysis of CP asymmetry in three-body decays of bottom baryons utilizing U-spin symmetry. We first develop a convenient representation that facilitates the incorporation of U-spin symmetry into our analysis. By integrating weak and strong phases into the derived amplitude, we obtain the CP asymmetry and establish relationships between CP asymmetries in U-spin related decay channels. With the help of experimental measurements, we provide numerical predictions for the CP asymmetries for other decay channels, particularly $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma^0 K^+ K^-$, $\Xi^0_b \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma^0 K^+ \pi^-$, and $\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma K^- \pi^+$. Furthermore, we provide a quantity that can be used as a null test of standard model and deviations from 0 will reflect the possible new physics. These results are valuable for CPV measurements in baryon decays, and can be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Proving and Rewarding Client Diversity to Strengthen Resilience of Blockchain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Client diversity in the Ethereum blockchain refers to the use of multiple independent implementations of the Ethereum protocol. This effectively enhances network resilience by reducing reliance on any single software client implementation. With client diversity, a single bug cannot tear the whole network down. However, despite multiple production-grade client implementations being available, there is still a heavily skewed distribution of clients in Ethereum. This is a concern for the community. In this paper, we introduce a novel conceptual framework for client diversity. The core goal is to improve the network resilience as a systemic property. Our key insight is to leverage economic incentives and verifiable execution to encourage the adoption of minority clients, thereby fostering a more robust blockchain ecosystem. Concretely, we propose to unambiguously and provably identify the client implementation used by any protocol participant, and to use this information to incentivize the usage of minority clients by offering higher participation rewards. We outline a detailed blueprint for our conceptual framework, in the realm of Ethereum. Our proposal is a game changer for improving client diversity of blockchains. Ultimately, it applies to strengthening the resilience of any decentralized distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to baryon masses from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice calculations of the masses of baryons containing the light, strange and charm quarks and their decompositions into sigma terms and trace anomaly. These results are obtained from 2+1 flavor QCD ensembles at 5 lattice spacings $a\in[0.05,0.11]$ fm, 4 spatial sizes $L\in[2.5, 5.1]$ fm, 7 pion masses $m_{\pi}\in[135,350]$ MeV, and several values of the strange quark mass. The continuum extrapolated masses of all the baryons agree with experiments at the 1\% level. We found that the glue part of the trace anomaly contributes about the same amount to the masses -- $\sim$ 0.8 - 0.95 GeV for the spin 1/2 baryons and $\sim$ 0.95 - 1.1 GeV for the spin 3/2 baryons -- given $\gamma_m\sim$ 0.3, and the sigma terms from the light, strange, and charm quarks are enhanced by factors of about 5, 2, and 1.3, respectively, compared to the renormalized quark mass themselves at \(\overline{\mathrm{MS}}\) 2 GeV.</description>

      <title>Iterative solutions of the ATDHFB equations to determine the nuclear collective inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterative adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) method is developed within the framework of Skyrme density functional theory. The ATDHFB equation is solved iteratively to avoid explicitly calculating the stability matrix. The contribution of the time-odd mean fields to the ATDHF(B) moment of inertia is incorporated self-consistently, and the results are verified by comparing them with the dynamical cranking predictions. The inertia mass tensor is calculated with the density-derivative term evaluated by numerical differentiation.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation dominated period (RD), and the matter dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the $R^2$ inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, taking into account the violations of slow roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar across both methods, regardless of the potential under consideration. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the RD and MD phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <title>When does a bridge become an aeroplane?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), knowledge transfer between highly-disparate structures (i.e., heterogeneous populations) remains a challenge. It has been proposed that heterogeneous transfer may be accomplished via intermediate structures that bridge the gap in information between the structures of interest. A key aspect of the technique is the idea that by varying parameters such as material properties and geometry, one structure can be continuously morphed into another. The current work demonstrates the development of these interpolating structures, via case studies involving the parameterisation of (and transfer between) a simple, simulated 'bridge' and 'aeroplane'. The facetious question 'When is a bridge not an aeroplane?' has been previously asked in the context of predicting positive transfer based on structural similarity. While the obvious answer to this question is 'Always,' the current work demonstrates that in some cases positive transfer can be achieved between highly-disparate systems.</description>

      <title>A new proof of nonlinear Landau damping for the 3D Vlasov-Poisson system near Poisson equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates nonlinear Landau damping in the 3D Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. We study the asymptotic stability of the Poisson equilibrium $\mu(v)=\frac{1}{\pi^2(1+|v|^2)^2}$
  under small perturbations. Building on the foundational work of Ionescu, Pausader, Wang, and Widmayer \cite{AIonescu2022}, we provide a streamlined proof of nonlinear Landau damping for the 3D unscreened VP system. Our analysis leverages sharp decay estimates, novel decomposition techniques to demonstrate the stabilization of the particle distribution and the decay of electric field. These results reveal the free transport-like behavior for the perturbed density $\rho(t,x)$, and enhance the understanding of Landau damping in an unconfined setting near stable equilibria.</description>

      <title>Deep Fourier-embedded Network for Bi-modal Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning provides a significant improvement of salient object detection combining both RGB and thermal images. However, existing deep learning-based models suffer from two major shortcomings. First, the computation and memory demands of Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity are unbearable, especially in handling high-resolution bi-modal feature fusion. Second, even if learning converges to an ideal solution, there remains a frequency gap between the prediction and ground truth. Therefore, we propose a purely fast Fourier transform-based model, namely deep Fourier-embedded network (DFENet), for learning bi-modal information of RGB and thermal images. On one hand, fast Fourier transform efficiently fetches global dependencies with low complexity. Inspired by this, we design modal-coordinated perception attention to fuse the frequency gap between RGB and thermal modalities with multi-dimensional representation enhancement. To obtain reliable detailed information during decoding, we design the frequency-decomposed edge-aware module (FEM) to clarify object edges by deeply decomposing low-level features. Moreover, we equip proposed Fourier residual channel attention block in each decoder layer to prioritize high-frequency information while aligning channel global relationships. On the other hand, we propose co-focus frequency loss (CFL) to steer FEM towards minimizing the frequency gap. CFL dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing the bi-modal edge information in the Fourier domain. This frequency-level refinement of edge features further contributes to the quality of the final pixel-level prediction. Extensive experiments on four bi-modal salient object detection benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed DFENet outperforms twelve existing state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Preserving Information: How does Topological Data Analysis improve Neural Network performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) require significant amounts of data and computational resources to achieve high effectiveness in performing the tasks for which they are trained. To reduce resource demands, various techniques, such as Neuron Pruning, are applied. Due to the complex structure of ANNs, interpreting the behavior of hidden layers and the features they recognize in the data is challenging. A lack of comprehensive understanding of which information is utilized during inference can lead to inefficient use of available data, thereby lowering the overall performance of the models. In this paper, we introduce a method for integrating Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the context of image recognition. This method significantly enhances the performance of neural networks by leveraging a broader range of information present in the data, enabling the model to make more informed and accurate predictions. Our approach, further referred to as Vector Stitching, involves combining raw image data with additional topological information derived through TDA methods. This approach enables the neural network to train on an enriched dataset, incorporating topological features that might otherwise remain unexploited or not captured by the network's inherent mechanisms. The results of our experiments highlight the potential of incorporating results of additional data analysis into the network's inference process, resulting in enhanced performance in pattern recognition tasks in digital images, particularly when using limited datasets. This work contributes to the development of methods for integrating TDA with deep learning and explores how concepts from Information Theory can explain the performance of such hybrid methods in practical implementation environments.</description>

Abstract: This study re examines the effect of nuclear deformation on the calculated Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of neutron deficient (178 192Hg, 185 194Pb and 196 206Po) nuclei. The nuclear ground state properties and shape parameters were calculated using the Relativistic Mean Field model. Three different density dependent interactions were used in the calculation. Estimated shape parameters were later used within the framework of deformed proton-neutron quasi random phase approximations model, with a separable interaction, to calculate the GT strength distributions, half lives and branching ratios for these neutron deficient isotopes. It was concluded that half lives and GT strength distributions vary considerably with change in shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Blind All-in-One Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind all-in-one image restoration models aim to recover a high-quality image from an input degraded with unknown distortions. However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamic Gesture Recognition at Ultra-Long Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic hand gestures play a crucial role in conveying nonverbal information for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), eliminating the need for complex interfaces. Current models for dynamic gesture recognition suffer from limitations in effective recognition range, restricting their application to close proximity scenarios. In this letter, we present a novel approach to recognizing dynamic gestures in an ultra-range distance of up to 28 meters, enabling natural, directive communication for guiding robots in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our proposed SlowFast-Transformer (SFT) model effectively integrates the SlowFast architecture with Transformer layers to efficiently process and classify gesture sequences captured at ultra-range distances, overcoming challenges of low resolution and environmental noise. We further introduce a distance-weighted loss function shown to enhance learning and improve model robustness at varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.1% on a diverse dataset with challenging ultra-range gestures. This enables robots to react appropriately to human commands from a far distance, providing an essential enhancement in HRI, especially in scenarios requiring seamless and natural interaction.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy scalar or pseudoscalar states in $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ events at CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for scalar or pseudoscalar states decaying to a top quark-antiquark pair ($\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$), using $138\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of pp collision data taken at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ using the CMS detector, is presented. Events with one or two leptons are analyzed using the invariant $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ mass ($m_{\mathrm{t \bar{t}}}$) as well as angular and spin correlation observables. An excess in the data is observed for low values of $m_{\mathrm{t \bar{t}}}$, preferring a pseudoscalar over a scalar hypothesis. It is interpreted in terms of a generic model of (pseudo)scalar boson production, as well as a simplified model of a $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ bound state ($\eta_{\mathrm{t}}$), yielding good agreement with the data. Moreover, limits on the couplings of additional (pseudo)scalar bosons to top quarks are set.</description>

      <title>Neural Image Unfolding: Flattening Sparse Anatomical Structures using Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic imaging reveals internal structures of 3D objects and is crucial for medical diagnoses. Visualizing the morphology and appearance of non-planar sparse anatomical structures that extend over multiple 2D slices in tomographic volumes is inherently difficult but valuable for decision-making and reporting. Hence, various organ-specific unfolding techniques exist to map their densely sampled 3D surfaces to a distortion-minimized 2D representation. However, there is no versatile framework to flatten complex sparse structures including vascular, duct or bone systems. We deploy a neural field to fit the transformation of the anatomy of interest to a 2D overview image. We further propose distortion regularization strategies and combine geometric with intensity-based loss formulations to also display non-annotated and auxiliary targets. In addition to improved versatility, our unfolding technique outperforms mesh-based baselines for sparse structures w.r.t. peak distortion and our regularization scheme yields smoother transformations compared to Jacobian formulations from neural field-based image registration.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic size-and-shape functional mixed models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable recovery and uncertainty quantification of a fixed effect function $\mu$ in a functional mixed model, for modelling population- and object-level variability in noisily observed functional data, is a notoriously challenging task: variations along the $x$ and $y$ axes are confounded with additive measurement error, and cannot in general be disentangled. The question then as to what properties of $\mu$ may be reliably recovered becomes important. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover the size-and-shape of a square-integrable $\mu$ under a Bayesian functional mixed model. The size-and-shape of $\mu$ is a geometric property invariant to a family of space-time unitary transformations, viewed as rotations of the Hilbert space, that jointly transform the $x$ and $y$ axes. A random object-level unitary transformation then captures size-and-shape \emph{preserving} deviations of $\mu$ from an individual function, while a random linear term and measurement error capture size-and-shape \emph{altering} deviations. The model is regularized by appropriate priors on the unitary transformations, posterior summaries of which may then be suitably interpreted as optimal data-driven rotations of a fixed orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space. Our numerical experiments demonstrate utility of the proposed model, and superiority over the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

Abstract: Let $T_m(N,2k)$ denote the $m$-th Hecke operator on the space $S_{2k}(\Gamma_0(N))$ of cuspidal modular forms of weight $2k$ and level $N$. In this paper, we study the non-repetition of the second coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of $T_m(N,2k)$. We obtain results in the horizontal aspect (where $m$ varies), the vertical aspect (where $k$ varies), and the level aspect (where $N$ varies). Finally, we use these non-repetition results to extend a result of Vilardi and Xue on distinguishing Hecke eigenforms.</description>

      <title>Predicting HCN, HCO$^+$, multi-transition CO, and dust emission of star-forming galaxies -- Extension to luminous infrared galaxies and the role of cosmic ray ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific star-formation rate of star-forming `main sequence' galaxies significantly decreased since z~1.5, due to the decreasing molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency. However, the radio-infrared (IR) correlation has not changed significantly since z~1.5. The theory of turbulent clumpy starforming gas disks together with the scaling relations of the interstellar medium describes the large and small-scale properties of galactic gas disks. Here we extend our previous work on infrared, multi-transition molecular line, and radio continuum emission of local and high-z starforming and starburst galaxies to local and z~0.5 luminous infrared galaxies. The model reproduces the IR luminosities, CO, HCN, and HCO+ line luminosities, and the CO spectral line energy distributions of these galaxies. We derive CO(1-0) and HCN(1-0) conversion factors for all galaxy samples. The relation between the star formation rate per unit area and H2 surface density cannot be fit simply for all redshifts. There is a tight correlation between the star formation efficiency and the product of the gas turbulent velocity dispersion and the angular velocity of the galaxies. Galaxies of lower stellar masses can in principle compensate their gas consumption via star formation by radial viscous gas accretion. The limiting stellar mass increases with redshift. Whereas the radio continuum emission is directly proportional to the density of cosmic ray (CR) electrons, the molecular line emission depends on the CR ionization rate via the gas chemistry. The normalization of the CR ionization rate found for the different galaxy samples is about a factor of three to five higher than the normalization for the Solar neighborhood. This means that the mean yield of low energy CR particles for a given star formation rate per unit area is about three to ten times higher in external galaxies than observed by Voyager I.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation: summation of non-local self-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the 2PI effective action formalism, we study false vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation of the path integral. We derive a coupled system of equations for the bounce and the propagator, and we compute a semi-analytic expression for the self-energy of a real scalar field with cubic and quartic interactions from the 2PI effective action truncated at two loops and without further approximations. Deriving numerical results, we can show that the Hartree approximation, where non-local contributions to the self-energy are neglected, is generally not justified. We find significant corrections to the negative eigenvalue and conclude that the summation of quantum corrections can have dramatic effects on the evaluation of the nucleation rate.</description>

      <title>Inertial dynamics with vanishing Tikhonov regularization for multobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce, in a Hilbert space setting, a second order dynamical system with asymptotically vanishing damping and vanishing Tikhonov regularization that approaches a multiobjective optimization problem with convex and differentiable components of the objective function. Trajectory solutions are shown to exist in finite dimensions. We prove fast convergence of the function values, quantified in terms of a merit function. Based on the regime considered, we establish both weak and, in some cases, strong convergence of trajectory solutions toward a weak Pareto optimal solution. To achieve this, we apply Tikhonov regularization individually to each component of the objective function. This work extends results from single objective convex optimization into the multiobjective setting.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Diverse Generative Robot Designs using Evolution and Intrinsic Motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for generative design of robot physical configurations can automatically find optimal and innovative solutions for challenging tasks in complex environments. The vast search-space includes the physical design-space and the controller parameter-space, making it a challenging problem in machine learning and optimisation in general. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promising results in generating robot designs via gradient-free optimisation. Morpho-evolution with learning (MEL) uses EAs to concurrently generate robot designs and learn the optimal parameters of the controllers. Two main issues prevent MEL from scaling to higher complexity tasks: computational cost and premature convergence to sub-optimal designs. To address these issues, we propose combining morpho-evolution with intrinsic motivations. Intrinsically motivated behaviour arises from embodiment and simple learning rules without external guidance. We use a homeokinetic controller that generates exploratory behaviour in a few seconds with reduced knowledge of the robot's design. Homeokinesis replaces costly learning phases, reducing computational time and favouring diversity, preventing premature convergence. We compare our approach with current MEL methods in several downstream tasks. The generated designs score higher in all the tasks, are more diverse, and are quickly generated compared to morpho-evolution with static parameters.</description>

      <title>FastSwitch: Optimizing Context Switching Efficiency in Fairness-aware Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising interest in Bayesian deep learning (BDL) has led to a plethora of methods for estimating the posterior distribution. However, efficient computation of inferences, such as predictions, has been largely overlooked with Monte Carlo integration remaining the standard. In this work we examine streamlining prediction in BDL through a single forward pass without sampling. For this we use local linearisation on activation functions and local Gaussian approximations at linear layers. Thus allowing us to analytically compute an approximation to the posterior predictive distribution. We showcase our approach for both MLP and transformers, such as ViT and GPT-2, and assess its performance on regression and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Cross-intersecting Families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m\geq 2$, $n$ be positive integers, and $R_i=\{k_{i,1} &gt;k_{i,2} &gt;\cdots&gt; k_{i,t_i}\}$ be subsets of $[n]$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,m$. The families $\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq \binom{[n]}{R_1},\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq \binom{[n]}{R_2},\ldots,\mathcal{F}_m\subseteq \binom{[n]}{R_m}$ are said to be non-empty cross-intersecting if for each $i\in [m]$, $\mathcal{F}_i\neq\emptyset$ and for any $A\in \mathcal{F}_i,B\in\mathcal{F}_j$, $1\leq i&lt;j\leq m$, $|A\bigcap B|\geq1$. In this paper, we determine the maximum value of $\sum_{j=1}^{m}|\mathcal{F}_j|$ for non-empty cross-intersecting family $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_m$ when $n\geq k_1+k_2$, where $k_1$ (respectively, $k_2$) is the largest (respectively, second largest) value in $\{k_{1,1},k_{2,1},\ldots,k_{m,1}\}$. This result is a generalization of the results by Shi, Frankl and Qian \cite{shi2022non} on non-empty cross-intersecting families. Moreover, the extremal families are completely characterized.</description>

      <title>Brick chain filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way.
  In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use.
  This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $\tau$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $\tau$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau$).</description>

Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path. This is an extended version of the paper accepted by KDD 2025.</description>

      <title>An AI-Assisted Multi-Agent Dual Dialogue System to Support Mental Health Care Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general-purpose, human-in-the-loop dual dialogue system to support mental health care professionals. The system, co-designed with care providers, is conceptualized to assist them in interacting with care seekers rather than functioning as a fully automated dialogue system solution. The AI assistant within the system reduces the cognitive load of mental health care providers by proposing responses, analyzing conversations to extract pertinent themes, summarizing dialogues, and recommending localized relevant content and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy exercises. These functionalities are achieved through a multi-agent system design, where each specialized, supportive agent is characterized by a large language model. In evaluating the multi-agent system, we focused specifically on the proposal of responses to emotionally distressed care seekers. We found that the proposed responses matched a reasonable human quality in demonstrating empathy, showing its appropriateness for augmenting the work of mental health care providers.</description>

      <title>Classical optimisation of reduced density matrix estimations with classical shadows using N-representability conditions under shot noise considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography has become a powerful tool in learning about quantum states prepared on a quantum computer. Recent works have used classical shadows to variationally enforce N-representability conditions on the 2-particle reduced density matrix. In this paper, we build upon previous research by choice of an improved estimator within classical shadow tomography and rephrasing the optimisation constraints, resulting in an overall enhancement in performance under comparable measurement shot budgets. We further explore the specific regimes where these methods outperform the unbiased estimator of the standalone classical shadow protocol and quantify the potential savings in numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon: The 1CGH Catalogue of Fermi-LAT detections above 10 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi-LAT satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified about 2900 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, including 69 reported here for the first time. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of about 500 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3.0. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources for understanding the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be effectively measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Smart Predict-then-Optimize Framework for Vehicle Relocation Problems in Large-Scale Vehicle Crowd Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ubiquitous mobile devices have catalyzed the development of vehicle crowd sensing (VCS). In particular, vehicle sensing systems show great potential in the flexible acquisition of spatio-temporal urban data through built-in sensors under diverse sensing scenarios. However, vehicle systems often exhibit biased coverage due to the heterogeneous nature of trip requests and routes. To achieve a high sensing coverage, a critical challenge lies in optimally relocating vehicles to minimize the divergence between vehicle distributions and target sensing distributions. Conventional approaches typically employ a two-stage predict-then-optimize (PTO) process: first predicting real-time vehicle distributions and subsequently generating an optimal relocation strategy based on the predictions. However, this approach can lead to suboptimal decision-making due to the propagation of errors from upstream prediction. To this end, we develop an end-to-end Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) framework by integrating optimization into prediction within the deep learning architecture, and the entire framework is trained by minimizing the task-specific matching divergence rather than the upstream prediction error. Methodologically, we formulate the vehicle relocation problem by quadratic programming (QP) and incorporate a novel unrolling approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the SPO framework to compute gradients of the QP layer, facilitating backpropagation and gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by real-world taxi datasets in Hong Kong. Utilizing the alternating differentiation method, the general SPO framework presents a novel concept of addressing decision-making problems with uncertainty, demonstrating significant potential for advancing applications in intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>A Latent Space Approach to Inferring Distance-Dependent Reciprocity in Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity, or the stochastic tendency for actors to form mutual relationships, is an essential characteristic of directed network data. Existing latent space approaches to modeling directed networks are severely limited by the assumption that reciprocity is homogeneous across the network. In this work, we introduce a new latent space model for directed networks that can model heterogeneous reciprocity patterns that arise from the actors' latent distances. Furthermore, existing edge-independent latent space models are nested within the proposed model class, which allows for meaningful model comparisons. We introduce a Bayesian inference procedure to infer the model parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Lastly, we use the proposed method to infer different reciprocity patterns in an advice network among lawyers, an information-sharing network between employees at a manufacturing company, and a friendship network between high school students.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the chiral anomaly. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ are constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios -- the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of the same pseudospin variety or of two distinct pseudospin-representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>6G Takes Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contours of 6G -- its key technical components and driving requirements -- are finally coming into focus. Through twenty questions and answers, this article defines the important aspects of 6G across four categories. First, we identify the key themes and forces driving the development of 6G, and what will make 6G unique. We argue that 6G requirements and system design will be driven by (i) the tenacious pursuit of spectral (bits/Hz/area), energy (bits/Joule), and cost (bits/dollar) efficiencies, and (ii) three new service enhancements: sensing/localization/awareness, compute, and global broadband/emergency connectivity. Second, we overview the important role of spectrum in 6G, what new spectrum to expect in 6G, and outline how the different bands will be used to provide 6G services. Third, we focus our attention on the 6G physical layer, including waveforms, MIMO advancements, and the potential use of deep learning. Finally, we explore how global connectivity will be achieved in 6G, through non-terrestrial networks as well as low-cost network expansion via disaggregation and O-RAN. Although 6G standardization activities will not begin until late 2025, meaning this article is by definition speculative, our predictions are informed by several years of intensive research and discussions. Our goal is to provide a grounded perspective that will be helpful to both researchers and engineers as we move into the 6G era.</description>

      <title>Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the Krylov operator complexity is proposed to evaluate the operator growth in quantum systems, and the variance of its Lanzcos coefficients is used as an important parameter for chaos. In this paper, we generate samples of random initial operators from given probability distribtions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution). For the Sinai billiard model, we study the statistical properties of the variance of Lanzcos coefficients in the associated Krylov space. Depending on whether the system is chaotic or not, the resulting distribution of the variance have different behaviors. In the nonchaotic case, the resulting distributions are almost overlapping together. In the chaotic case, they split into two well-separated groups. Besides, all the resulting distributions of the variance are the normal distribution, as long as the matrix size of the initial operator is large enough. This overlap-to-separation behavior, in the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanczos coefficients, may be a characteristics to distinguish chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Shift spin photocurrents in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of nonlinear spin photocurrents by circularly polarized light in two-dimensional systems is theoretically investigated by calculating the shift spin conductivities. In time-reversal symmetric systems, shift spin photocurrent can be generated under the irradiation of circularly polarized light , while the shift charge photoccurrent is forbidden by symmetry. We show that $k$-cubic Rashba-Dresselhaus system, the $k$-cubic Wurtzite system and Dirac surface states can support the shift spin photocurrent. By symmetry analysis, it is found that in the Rashba type spin-orbit coupled systems, mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent are parallel, which we name as longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. The Dirac surface states with warping term exhibit mirror symmetry, similar to the Rashba type system, and support longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. In contrast, in the Dresselhaus type spin-orbit coupled systems, the parity-mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent are perpendicular, which we dub as transverse shift spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we find that the shift spin photocurrent always vanishes in any $k$-linear spin-orbit coupled system unless the Zeeman coupling is turned on. We find that the splitting of degenerate energy bands due to Zeeman coupling $\mu_z$ causes the van Hove singularity. The resulting shift spin conductivity has a significant peak at optical frequency $\omega=2\mu_z/\hbar$.</description>

      <title>Personalized Generative AI in VR for Enhanced Engagement: Eye-Tracking Insights into Cultural Heritage Learning through Neapolitan Pizza Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) are transforming personalized learning, particularly in intangible cultural heritage (ICH) education. However, designing immersive experiences that enhance engagement without overwhelming learners presents a challenge. This study examines the impact of personalized AI narration on user engagement and attention in a VR environment through eye-tracking metrics. In a controlled experiment with 54 participants, we explored three levels of personalization (high, moderate, none) in a Neapolitan pizza-making task, measuring attention and cognitive load through fixation duration, saccade duration, and pupil diameter. Results indicate that high personalization increased engagement by 64.1% over no personalization (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, regression analysis reveals specific eye-tracking metrics significantly predict gameplay duration, underscoring eye-tracking's potential to capture real-time engagement. These findings support the use of eye-tracking to inform the development of adaptive VR learning experiences. Future work may integrate subjective assessments to better understand users' underlying motivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysics, understanding the evolution of galaxies in primarily through imaging data is fundamental to comprehending the formation of the Universe. This paper introduces a novel approach to conditioning Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) on redshifts for generating galaxy images. We explore whether this advanced generative model can accurately capture the physical characteristics of galaxies based solely on their images and redshift measurements. Our findings demonstrate that this model not only produces visually realistic galaxy images but also encodes the underlying changes in physical properties with redshift that are the result of galaxy evolution. This approach marks a significant advancement in using generative models to enhance our scientific insight into cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-field ultra-high-speed (UHS) x-ray imaging experiments have been well established to characterize various processes and phenomena. However, the potential of UHS experiments through the joint acquisition of x-ray videos with distinct configurations has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we investigate the use of a deep learning-based spatio-temporal fusion (STF) framework to fuse two complementary sequences of x-ray images and reconstruct the target image sequence with high spatial resolution, high frame rate, and high fidelity. We applied a transfer learning strategy to train the model and compared the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), average absolute difference (AAD), and structural similarity (SSIM) of the proposed framework on two independent x-ray datasets with those obtained from a baseline deep learning model, a Bayesian fusion framework, and the bicubic interpolation method. The proposed framework outperformed the other methods with various configurations of the input frame separations and image noise levels. With 3 subsequent images from the low resolution (LR) sequence of a 4-time lower spatial resolution and another 2 images from the high resolution (HR) sequence of a 20-time lower frame rate, the proposed approach achieved an average PSNR of 37.57 dB and 35.15 dB, respectively. When coupled with the appropriate combination of high-speed cameras, the proposed approach will enhance the performance and therefore scientific value of the UHS x-ray imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Metric-DST: Mitigating Selection Bias Through Diversity-Guided Semi-Supervised Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selection bias poses a critical challenge for fairness in machine learning, as models trained on data that is less representative of the population might exhibit undesirable behavior for underrepresented profiles. Semi-supervised learning strategies like self-training can mitigate selection bias by incorporating unlabeled data into model training to gain further insight into the distribution of the population. However, conventional self-training seeks to include high-confidence data samples, which may reinforce existing model bias and compromise effectiveness. We propose Metric-DST, a diversity-guided self-training strategy that leverages metric learning and its implicit embedding space to counter confidence-based bias through the inclusion of more diverse samples. Metric-DST learned more robust models in the presence of selection bias for generated and real-world datasets with induced bias, as well as a molecular biology prediction task with intrinsic bias. The Metric-DST learning strategy offers a flexible and widely applicable solution to mitigate selection bias and enhance fairness of machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic LiDAR Odometry for Mobile Robots with Structured Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a real-time dynamic LiDAR odometry pipeline for mobile robots in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios. Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.</description>

      <title>Is my Meeting Summary Good? Estimating Quality with a Multi-LLM Evaluator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of meeting summaries generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems is hard to measure automatically. Established metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore have a relatively low correlation with human judgments and fail to capture nuanced errors. Recent studies suggest using large language models (LLMs), which have the benefit of better context understanding and adaption of error definitions without training on a large number of human preference judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluators risk masking errors and can only serve as a weak proxy, leaving human evaluation the gold standard despite being costly and hard to compare across studies. In this work, we present MESA, an LLM-based framework employing a three-step assessment of individual error types, multi-agent discussion for decision refinement, and feedback-based self-training to refine error definition understanding and alignment with human judgment. We show that MESA's components enable thorough error detection, consistent rating, and adaptability to custom error guidelines. Using GPT-4o as its backbone, MESA achieves mid to high Point-Biserial correlation with human judgment in error detection and mid Spearman and Kendall correlation in reflecting error impact on summary quality, on average 0.25 higher than previous methods. The framework's flexibility in adapting to custom error guidelines makes it suitable for various tasks with limited human-labeled data.</description>

      <title>Compact finite-difference scheme for some Sobolev type equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to construct a stable, high-order compact finite difference method for solving Sobolev-type equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in one-space dimension. Approximation of higher-order mixed derivatives in some specific Sobolev-type equations requires a bigger stencil information. One can approximate such derivatives on compact stencils, which are higher-order accurate and take less stencil information but are implicit and sparse. Spatial derivatives in this work are approximated using the sixth-order compact finite difference method (Compact6), while temporal derivatives are handled with the explicit forward Euler difference scheme. We examine the accuracy and convergence behavior of the proposed scheme. Using the von Neumann stability analysis, we establish $L_2-$stability theory for the linear case. We derive conditions under which fully discrete schemes are stable. Also, the amplification factor $\mathcal{C}(\theta)$ is analyzed to ensure the decay property over time. Real parts of $\mathcal{C}(\theta)$ lying on the negative real axis confirm the exponential decay of the solution. A series of numerical experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. These tests include advection-free flow, and applications to the equal width equation, such as single solitary wave propagation, interactions of two and three solitary waves, undular bore formation, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Interlayer couplings in cuprates: structural origins, analytical forms, and structural estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantitatively identify the multiple distinct microscopic mechanisms contributing to effective interlayer couplings (EICs) by performing first-principle calculations for two prototype superconducting cuprate families, pristine and doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCuO$_2$O$_{8+x}$ and Pr$_{x}$Y$_{1-x}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$. The major mechanisms are mediated by interlayer oxygen $p_{\sigma}$-$p_{\sigma}$ and $p_z$-$p_z$ hoppings as well as interlayer copper $d_{z^2}$-oxygen $p_{\sigma}$ hoppings. Furthermore, we show how EICs are closely related to structural distortions such as layer bucklings and bond length changes. This allows us to provide analytical formulae that permit direct estimation of the key interatomic hoppings and the EICs based only on the crystal structure. Finally, we benchmark our method on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ to estimate the strength and anisotropy of the EIC.</description>

      <title>Continuous Autoregressive Models with Noise Augmentation Avoid Error Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models are typically applied to sequences of discrete tokens, but recent research indicates that generating sequences of continuous embeddings in an autoregressive manner is also feasible. However, such Continuous Autoregressive Models (CAMs) can suffer from a decline in generation quality over extended sequences due to error accumulation during inference. We introduce a novel method to address this issue by injecting random noise into the input embeddings during training. This procedure makes the model robust against varying error levels at inference. We further reduce error accumulation through an inference procedure that introduces low-level noise. Experiments on musical audio generation show that CAM substantially outperforms existing autoregressive and non-autoregressive approaches while preserving audio quality over extended sequences. This work paves the way for generating continuous embeddings in a purely autoregressive setting, opening new possibilities for real-time and interactive generative applications.</description>

      <title>A Game-theoretic model of forex trading with stochastic strategies and information asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction strategies for reward in competitive environments are significantly influenced by the nature and extent of available information.In financial markets,particularly foreign exchange(forex),traders operate independently with limited information,often yielding highly unpredictable outcomes.This study introduces a game theoretic framework modeling the market as a strategically active participant,rather than a neutral entity, within a stochastic,imperfect information setting.In this model,the market alternates sequentially with new traders,each trader having limited visibility of the market's moves,while the market observes and counteracts each trader strategy.Through a series of simulations,we show that this information asymmetry enables the market to consistently outperform traders on aggregate.This outcome suggests that real world forex environments may inherently favor market structures with greater informational advantage,challenging the perception of a level playing field.The model provides a basis for simulating skewed information environments,highlighting how strategic imbalances contribute to trader losses.Further optimization of the intelligent market scoring and refined simulations of trader market interactions can enhance predictive analytics for forex,offering a robust tool for market behavior analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth integral two-form and a smooth potential on the flat torus of dimension 2, we study the high energy properties of the corresponding magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. Under a geometric condition on the magnetic field, we show that every sequence of high energy eigenfunctions satisfies the quantum unique ergodicity property even if the Liouville measure is not ergodic for the underlying classical flow (the Euclidean geodesic flow on the 2-torus).</description>

      <title>Towards quantum error correction with two-body gates for quantum registers based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond provide a possible hardware for quantum computation, where the most basic quantum information processing unit are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, each in contact with adjacent carbon nuclear spins. With specifically tailored dynamical decoupling sequences, it is possible to execute selective, high-fidelity two-body gates between the electron spin of the NV center and a targeted nuclear spin. In this work, we present a method to determine the optimal execution time that balances the trade-off between fidelity and execution speed for gates generated by adaptive XY sequences. With these optimized gates, we use the nuclear spin environment as a code space for quantum error correction within a color center register.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is a critical health condition caused by restricted blood flow to the heart. Early-stage detection through continuous ECG monitoring is essential to minimize irreversible damage. This review explores advancements in MI classification methodologies for wearable devices, emphasizing their potential in real-time monitoring and early diagnosis. It critically examines traditional approaches, such as morphological filtering and wavelet decomposition, alongside cutting-edge techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and VLSI-based methods. By synthesizing findings on machine learning, deep learning, and hardware innovations, this paper highlights their strengths, limitations, and future prospects. The integration of these techniques into wearable devices offers promising avenues for efficient, accurate, and energy-aware MI detection, paving the way for next-generation wearable healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>Self-similar instability and forced nonuniqueness: an application to the 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on an approach introduced by Golovkin in the '60s, we show that nonuniqueness in some forced PDEs is a direct consequence of the existence of a self-similar linearly unstable eigenvalue: the key point is a clever choice of the forcing term removing complicated nonlinear interactions. We use this method to give a short and self-contained proof of nonuniqueness in 2D perfect fluids, first obtained in Vishik's groundbreaking result. In particular, we present a direct construction of a forced self-similar unstable vortex, where we treat perturbatively the self-similar operator in a new and more quantitative way.</description>

      <title>Nondegenerate module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the work of Shimizu (2019), various nondegeneracy conditions for braided finite tensor categories are equivalent. This theory is extended to braided module categories here. We introduce when a braided module category is "nondegenerate" and "factorizable", and establish that these properties are equivalent. The proof involves a new monadicity result for module categories. Lastly, we examine the Hopf case, using Kolb's (2020) notion of a quasitriangular comodule algebra to introduce "factorizable" comodule algebras. We then show that the representation category of a quasitriangular comodule algebra is nondegenerate in our sense precisely when the comodule algebra is factorizable. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Coverage in Convex Quadrilateral Regions with a Single UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the optimal hovering altitude of a single UAV to provide coverage over any convex quadrilateral region on the ground. The UAV employs a directional antenna with a tiltable beam, producing an elliptical coverage pattern. Two scenarios are considered: (1) inscribing the largest ellipse within the quadrilateral to cover its interior, and (2) circumscribing the smallest ellipse about the quadrilateral to ensure full coverage. We derive the optimal UAV altitude and antenna tilt conditions in both scenarios for a simplified yet widely accepted path loss model and present numerical results for coverage efficiency. The work contributes to the development of energy-efficient UAV-based communication systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmological solutions in teleparallel $F(T,B)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we find several teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for a Robertson-Walker (TRW) cosmological spacetime. We first set and solve the $F(T,B)$-type field equations for a linear perfect fluid. Using similar techniques, we then find new $F(T,B)$ solutions for non-linear perfect fluids with a weak-quadratic correction term to the linear equation of state (EoS). Finally, we solve for new classes of $F(T,B)$ solutions for a scalar field source by assuming a power-law scalar field and then an exponential scalar field in terms of the time-coordinate. For flat cosmological cases ($k=0$ cases), we find new exact and approximate $F(T,B)$ solutions. For non-flat cases ($k=\pm 1$ cases), we only find new teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for some specific and well-defined cosmological expansion subcases. We conclude by briefly discussing the impact of these new teleparallel solutions on cosmological processes such as dark energy quintessence and phantom energy models.</description>

      <title>Synthetic ECG Generation for Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning in Arrhythmia Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models need a sufficient amount of data in order to be able to find the hidden patterns in it. It is the purpose of generative modeling to learn the data distribution, thus allowing us to sample more data and augment the original dataset. In the context of physiological data, and more specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, given its sensitive nature and expensive data collection, we can exploit the benefits of generative models in order to enlarge existing datasets and improve downstream tasks, in our case, classification of heart rhythm.
  In this work, we explore the usefulness of synthetic data generated with different generative models from Deep Learning namely Diffweave, Time-Diffusion and Time-VQVAE in order to obtain better classification results for two open source multivariate ECG datasets. Moreover, we also investigate the effects of transfer learning, by fine-tuning a synthetically pre-trained model and then progressively adding increasing proportions of real data. We conclude that although the synthetic samples resemble the real ones, the classification improvement when simply augmenting the real dataset is barely noticeable on individual datasets, but when both datasets are merged the results show an increase across all metrics for the classifiers when using synthetic samples as augmented data. From the fine-tuning results the Time-VQVAE generative model has shown to be superior to the others but not powerful enough to achieve results close to a classifier trained with real data only. In addition, methods and metrics for measuring closeness between synthetic data and the real one have been explored as a side effect of the main research questions of this study.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Extension Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier extension conjecture in $n\geq 2$ dimensions is, \begin{equation*}
  \left\Vert \widehat{fd\sigma _{n-1}}\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}%
  ^{n}\right) }\leq C_{p}\left\Vert f\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \sigma
  _{n-1}\right) },\ \text{for }f\in L^{p}\left( \sigma _{n-1}\right) \text{
  and }p&gt;\frac{2n}{n-1},
  \end{equation*} where $\sigma _{n-1}$ is surface measure on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. We give a detailed proof of this conjecture in dimension $n=3$ that uses trilinear estimates for Fourier transforms of smooth Alpert wavelets, corresponding local linear Fourier estimates for smooth Alpert wavelets with geometric decay, and the deterministic estimates from the author's paper on probabilistic Fourier extension. The higher dimensional proof follows the same lines, and we give a brief description of it at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odinger equations with $B_\infty$ potentials in the region above a Lipschitz graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the $L^p$ regularity, $L^p$ Neumann and $W^{1,p}$ problems for generalized Schr\"odinger operator $-\text{div}(A\nabla )+ V $ in the region above a Lipschitz graph under the assumption that $A$ is elliptic, symmetric and $x_d-$independent. Specifically, we prove that the $L^p$ regularity problem is uniquely solvable for $$1&lt;p&lt;2+\varepsilon.$$
  Moreover, we also establish the $W^{1,p}$ estimate for Neumann problem for
  $$\frac{3}{2}-\varepsilon&lt;p&lt;3+\varepsilon.$$
  As a by-product, we also obtain that the $L^p$ Neumann problem is uniquely solvable for $1&lt;p&lt;2+\varepsilon.$
  The only previously known estimates of this type pertain to the classical Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta u+ Vu=0$ in $\Omega$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=g$ on $\partial\Omega$ which was obtained by Shen [Z. Shen, On the Neumann problem for Schr\"odinger operators in Lipschitz domains, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 43 (1994)] for ranges $1&lt;p\leq 2$.
  All the ranges of $p$ are sharp.</description>

      <title>What do physics-informed DeepONets learn? Understanding and improving training for scientific computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep operator networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a promising approach toward numerically approximating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we aim to develop further understanding of what is being learned by physics-informed DeepONets by assessing the universality of the extracted basis functions and demonstrating their potential toward model reduction with spectral methods. Results provide clarity about measuring the performance of a physics-informed DeepONet through the decays of singular values and expansion coefficients. In addition, we propose a transfer learning approach for improving training for physics-informed DeepONets between parameters of the same PDE as well as across different, but related, PDEs where these models struggle to train well. This approach results in significant error reduction and learned basis functions that are more effective in representing the solution of a PDE.</description>

      <title>Central kpc of Andromeda. I. Dynamical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the most nearby giant spiral galaxy, an opportunity to study with high resolution dynamical phenomena occurring in nuclear disks and bulges, able to explain star formation quenching, and galaxy evolution through collisions and tides. Multi-wavelength data have revealed in the central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered tilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our goal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical model, reproducing the global features of the observations. We are reporting about integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas with H$\alpha$ and [NII] obtained with SITELLE, the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) at the Canada France Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Using the fully sampled velocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas velocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope, and the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the main disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central kpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with small contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo. The kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this potential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit helps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas components, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are compatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as previously proposed. The kinematical observations correspond to a dynamical re-orientation of the perturbed nuclear disk, through warps and tearing disk into ring, following the collision.</description>

      <title>Scale Economies and Aggregate Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to investigate the link between rising scale economies and stagnating productivity. Our model features heterogeneous firms, imperfect competition, and firm selection. We demonstrate that scale economies generated by fixed costs have distinct impacts on aggregate productivity compared to those driven by returns to scale. Using UK data, we estimate long-run increases in both fixed costs and returns to scale. Our model implies that this should increase aggregate productivity through improved firm selection and resource allocation. However, increasing markups can offset the productivity gain. Higher markups cushion low-productivity firms' revenues, allowing them to survive, and constrain firm output, which limits exploitation of scale economies.</description>

      <title>Draft Model Knows When to Stop: A Self-Verification Length Policy for Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has become an important technique in accelerating the inference speed of large language models. Conventional SD methods employ a fixed draft length, which ignores the token generation difficulty across tasks. Consequently, in this paper, we address such an issue and introduce SVIP - a difficulty-aware dynamic draft length policy for speculative decoding systems. Based on a theoretical lower bound of draft token acceptance rate and its inference-time approximation, SVIP adaptively determines the lengths of draft sequences based on the entropy of each draft token distribution. Experimental results on mainstream SD benchmarks and frameworks demonstrate the superior performance of SVIP, achieving up to 20\% walltime speedup on SpecBench over baseline SD methods and 60\% speedup on MT-Bench for long-form generation of up to 8K tokens. Moreover, SVIP is totally training-free and compatible with any existing SD methods that generate draft tokens autoregressively. Experimental results also show that SVIP yields consistent walltime improvement on top of GliDe &amp; CaPE and EAGLE-2.</description>

      <title>Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures. By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design.</description>

      <title>Approximating Mathematical Constants using Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we will use Minecraft to experimentally approximate the values of four different mathematical constants. The mathematical constants that we will approximate are $\sqrt{2}, \pi$, Euler's number $e$, and Ap\'{e}ry's constant $\zeta(3)$. We will begin each section with a brief history of the number being approximated and describe where it appears in mathematics. We then explain how we used Minecraft mechanics to approximate the constant. At the end of each section, we provide some ideas for how to apply our techniques to the approximation of other mathematical constants in Minecraft or elsewhere. This article is a proof of concept that Minecraft can be used in higher education. We should note that the goal of this article is not to have the most accurate approximations possible, the goal is to inspire people to have fun while learning about various mathematical topics. We hope you learn something new in this article and feel inspired to try some of these techniques on your own.</description>

      <title>A unimodular random graph with large upper growth and no growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unimodular random rooted graph with maximal degree $d\geq 3$ and upper growth rate $d-1$, which does not have a growth rate. Ab\'ert, Fraczyk and Hayes showed that for a unimodular random tree, if the upper growth rate is at least $\sqrt{d-1}$, then the growth rate exists, and asked with some scepticism if this may hold for more general graphs. Our construction shows that the answer is negative. We also provide a non-hyperfinite example of a unimodular random graph with no growth rate. This may be of interest in light of a conjecture of Ab\'ert that unimodular Riemannian surfaces of bounded negative curvature always have growth.</description>

      <title>Complexity Experts are Task-Discriminative Learners for Any Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in all-in-one image restoration models have revolutionized the ability to address diverse degradations through a unified framework. However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

      <title>New Weighted Sum of Gray Gases (WSGG) Models for Radiation Calculation in Carbon Capture Simulations: Evaluation and Different Implementation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply several weighted sum of gray gases models (WSGGMs) to calculate the radiative absorption coefficient for gas mixtures containing H2O and CO2. Our main objectives are to analyze and compare four WSGGMs which have been recently developed for oxy-fuel combustion. The models are compared with the widely-used air-fuel WSGGM of Smith et al. In addition to direct comparison of the absorption coefficients, we compare finite-volume solutions of the radiative equation of transfer in a 2m x 2m x 4m box with a specified inhomogeneous temperature field and a homogeneous mixture of the H2O, CO2 and N2. Calculations using a spectral line-based WSGGM (SLW) are used as a reference solution to estimate the accuracy. For each WSGGM, we apply two interpolation methods for determining the model coefficients at arbitrary H2O-to-CO2 ratios. For wet-recycle oxy-fuel combustion, we found that the deviation of the air-fuel WSGGM was not significantly larger than several of the newer models. However, with dry recycle (90 vol%-CO2) the air-fuel WSGGM model underpredicts the radiative flux and radiative heat source in contrast to the other models which overpredict these fields. Piecewise linear interpolation consistently improves the predictions of the air-fuel WSGGM, but only has a modest effect on the predictions of the oxy-fuel WSGGM's.</description>

Abstract: En plus de soixante ans, huit pr\'esidents se sont succ\'ed\'e \`a la t\^ete de la Ve R\'epublique fran\c{c}aise (de Gaulle, Pompidou, Giscard d'Estaing, Mitterrand, Chirac, Sarkozy, Hollande, Macron).

Une analyse plus approfondie r\'ev\`ele les s\'equences typiques de chaque locataire de l'\'Elys\'ee. Bas\'ee sur les distances entre l'ensemble des allocutions, une figure illustre les similitudes et diff\'erences entre les diff\'erents pr\'esidents.
  Over the past sixty-six years, eight presidents successively headed the Fifth French Republic (de Gaulle, Pompidou, Giscard d'Estaing, Mitterrand, Chirac, Sarkozy, Holland, Macron). After presenting the corpus of their speeches -- 9,202 texts and more than 20 million labelled words -- the style of each of them will be characterized by their vocabulary (lemmas and part-of-speech). A deeper analysis reveals the typical sequences of each tenant of the Elys\'ee. Based on an intertextual distance between all presidential speeches, a synthesis can be drawn reflecting the similarities and differences between presidents.</description>

      <title>The importance of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars are mostly found in binary and multiple systems, as at least 50% of all solar-like stars have companions - a fraction that goes up to 100% for the most massive stars. Moreover, a large fraction of them will interact in some way or another over the course of their lives. Such interactions can, and often will, alter the structure and evolution of both components in the system. This will, in turn, lead to the production of exotic objects whose existence cannot be explained by standard single star evolution models, including gravitational wave progenitors, blue stragglers, symbiotic and barium stars, novae, and supernovae. More generally, binary stars prove crucial in many aspects, ranging from cultural ones, to constraining models of stellar evolution, star formation, and even, possibly, of gravity itself. They also provide a quasi-model independent way to determine stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. We here provide a brief summary of the importance of binary stars.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled PT-Symmetric Models in Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum field theories are a promising tool to study open quantum systems. These theories preserve unitarity if PT-symmetry is respected, and in that case an equivalent Hermitian description exists via the so-called Dyson map. Generically, PT-symmetric non-Hermitian theories can also feature phases where PT-symmetry is broken and unitarity is lost. We review the construction of holographic duals to strongly coupled PT-symmetric quantum field theories and the study of their phase diagram. We next focus on spacetime-dependent non-Hermitian couplings: non-Hermitian quenches and lattices. They violate the null energy condition in the gravity dual. The lattices realize phases supporting an imaginary current that breaks PT-symmetry spontaneously. Remarkably, these non-Hermitian lattices flow to a PT-symmetric fixed point in the IR.</description>

      <title>Isolating authorship from content with semantic embeddings and contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship has entangled style and content inside. Authors frequently write about the same topics in the same style, so when different authors write about the exact same topic the easiest way out to distinguish them is by understanding the nuances of their style. Modern neural models for authorship can pick up these features using contrastive learning, however, some amount of content leakage is always present. Our aim is to reduce the inevitable impact and correlation between content and authorship. We present a technique to use contrastive learning (InfoNCE) with additional hard negatives synthetically created using a semantic similarity model. This disentanglement technique aims to distance the content embedding space from the style embedding space, leading to embeddings more informed by style. We demonstrate the performance with ablations on two different datasets and compare them on out-of-domain challenges. Improvements are clearly shown on challenging evaluations on prolific authors with up to a 10% increase in accuracy when the settings are particularly hard. Trials on challenges also demonstrate the preservation of zero-shot capabilities of this method as fine tuning.</description>

      <title>HEMGS: A Hybrid Entropy Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made 3D Gaussians popular for 3D modeling and image rendering, but this creates big challenges in data storage and transmission. To obtain a highly compact 3DGS representation, we propose a hybrid entropy model for Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) data compression, which comprises two primary components, a hyperprior network and an autoregressive network. To effectively reduce structural redundancy across attributes, we apply a progressive coding algorithm to generate hyperprior features, in which we use previously compressed attributes and location as prior information. In particular, to better extract the location features from these compressed attributes, we adopt a domain-aware and instance-aware architecture to respectively capture domain-aware structural relations without additional storage costs and reveal scene-specific features through MLPs. Additionally, to reduce redundancy within each attribute, we leverage relationships between neighboring compressed elements within the attributes through an autoregressive network. Given its unique structure, we propose an adaptive context coding algorithm with flexible receptive fields to effectively capture adjacent compressed elements. Overall, we integrate our HEMGS into an end-to-end optimized 3DGS compression framework and the extensive experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that our method achieves about 40\% average reduction in size while maintaining the rendering quality over our baseline method and achieving state-of-the-art compression results.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Framework Considering Multi-temporal Information for Large-scale Cropland Mapping with Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately mapping large-scale cropland is crucial for agricultural production management and planning. Currently, the combination of remote sensing data and deep learning techniques has shown outstanding performance in cropland mapping. However, those approaches require massive precise labels, which are labor-intensive. To reduce the label cost, this study presented a weakly supervised framework considering multi-temporal information for large-scale cropland mapping. Specifically, we extract high-quality labels according to their consistency among global land cover (GLC) products to construct the supervised learning signal. On the one hand, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by the model's over-trust of remaining errors in high-quality labels, we encode the similarity/aggregation of cropland in the visual/spatial domain to construct the unsupervised learning signal, and take it as the regularization term to constrain the supervised part. On the other hand, to sufficiently leverage the plentiful information in the samples without high-quality labels, we also incorporate the unsupervised learning signal in these samples, enriching the diversity of the feature space. After that, to capture the phenological features of croplands, we introduce dense satellite image time series (SITS) to extend the proposed framework in the temporal dimension. We also visualized the high dimensional phenological features to uncover how multi-temporal information benefits cropland extraction, and assessed the method's robustness under conditions of data scarcity. The proposed framework has been experimentally validated for strong adaptability across three study areas (Hunan Province, Southeast France, and Kansas) in large-scale cropland mapping, and the internal mechanism and temporal generalizability are also investigated.</description>

      <title>A comparison of extended object tracking with multi-modal sensors in indoor environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary study of an efficient object tracking approach, comparing the performance of two different 3D point cloud sensory sources: LiDAR and stereo cameras, which have significant price differences. In this preliminary work, we focus on single object tracking. We first developed a fast heuristic object detector that utilizes prior information about the environment and target. The resulting target points are subsequently fed into an extended object tracking framework, where the target shape is parameterized using a star-convex hypersurface model. Experimental results show that our object tracking method using a stereo camera achieves performance similar to that of a LiDAR sensor, with a cost difference of more than tenfold.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Beyond Examples: High-level Automated Reasoning Paradigm in In-Context Learning via MCTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to tackle downstream tasks through sophisticated prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, this traditional ICL paradigm shows limitations when facing complex mathematical reasoning tasks, primarily due to its heavy dependence on example quality and the necessity for human intervention in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper presents HiAR-ICL, a \textbf{Hi}gh-level \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}easoning paradigm in \textbf{ICL} that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract thinking patterns, extending the conventional concept of context in ICL. HiAR-ICL introduces five atomic reasoning actions as fundamental components for constructing chain-structured patterns. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search, we explore reasoning paths and construct thought cards to guide subsequent inference. We then develop a cognitive complexity framework that dynamically matches problems with appropriate thought cards. Experimental results demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (79.6$\%$) on the MATH benchmark with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, surpassing GPT-4o (76.6$\%$) and Claude 3.5 (71.1$\%$).</description>

      <title>SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.</description>

      <title>A Novel Q-stem Connected Architecture for Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has garnered significant research interest recently due to its ability to generalize existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures and provide enhanced performance through flexible inter-connection among RIS elements. However, current BD-RIS designs often face challenges related to high circuit complexity and computational complexity, and there is limited study on the trade-off between system performance and circuit complexity. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel BD-RIS architecture named Q-stem connected RIS that integrates the characteristics of existing single connected, tree connected, and fully connected BD-RIS, facilitating an effective trade-off between system performance and circuit complexity. Additionally, we propose two algorithms to design the RIS scattering matrix for a Q-stem connected RIS aided multi-user broadcast channels, namely, a low-complexity least squares (LS) algorithm and a suboptimal LS-based quasi-Newton algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed architecture is capable of attaining the sum channel gain achieved by fully connected RIS while reducing the circuit complexity. Moreover, the proposed LS-based quasi-Newton algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines, while the LS algorithm provides comparable performance with a substantial reduction in computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance: Examining in Psychometric Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance, a systematic graphical framework for evaluating bias and determining its acceptability under varying experimental conditions. Absolute Relative Bias (ARB), while useful for understanding bias, is sensitive to outliers and population parameter magnitudes, often overstating bias for small values and understating it for larger ones. Similarly, Relative Efficiency (RE) can be influenced by variance differences and outliers, occasionally producing counterintuitive values exceeding 100%, which complicates interpretation. By addressing the limitations of traditional metrics such as Absolute Relative Bias (ARB) and Relative Efficiency (RE), the proposed graphical methodology framework leverages ridgeline plots and standardized estimate to provide a comprehensive visualization of parameter estimate distributions. Ridgeline plots done this way offer a robust alternative by visualizing full distributions, highlighting variability, trends, outliers, descriptive and facilitating more informed decision-making. This study employs multivariate Latent Growth Models (LGM) and Monte Carlo simulations to examine the performance of growth curve modeling under planned missing data designs, focusing on parameter estimate recovery and efficiency. By combining innovative visualization techniques with rigorous simulation methods, Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance provides a versatile and interpretable toolset for advancing quantitative research in bias evaluation and efficiency assessment.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Analysis for Canonical Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a large deviation theory developed for functionals of canonical Gibbs processes, i.e., Gibbs processes with respect to the binomial point process. We study the regime of a fixed intensity in a sequence of increasing windows. Our method relies on the traditional large deviation result for local bounded functionals of Poisson point processes noting that the binomial point process is obtained from the Poisson point process by conditioning on the point number. Our main methodological contribution is the development of coupling constructions allowing us to handle delicate and unlikely pathological events. The presented results cover three types of Gibbs models - a model given by a bounded local interaction, a model given by a non-negative possibly unbounded increasing local interaction and the hard-core interaction model. The derived large deviation principle is formulated for the distributions of individual empirical fields driven by canonical Gibbs processes, with its special case being a large deviation principle for local bounded observables of the canonical Gibbs processes. We also consider unbounded non-negative increasing local observables, but the price for treating this more general case is that we only get large-deviation bounds for the tails of such observables. Our primary setting is one with the periodic boundary condition, however, we also discuss generalizations for different choices of the boundary condition.</description>

      <title>SPTTE: A Spatiotemporal Probabilistic Framework for Travel Time Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation is essential for navigation and itinerary planning. While existing research employs probabilistic modeling to assess travel time uncertainty and account for correlations between multiple trips, modeling the temporal variability of multi-trip travel time distributions remains a significant challenge. Capturing the evolution of joint distributions requires large, well-organized datasets; however, real-world trip data are often temporally sparse and spatially unevenly distributed. To address this issue, we propose SPTTE, a spatiotemporal probabilistic framework that models the evolving joint distribution of multi-trip travel times by formulating the estimation task as a spatiotemporal stochastic process regression problem with fragmented observations. SPTTE incorporates an RNN-based temporal Gaussian process parameterization to regularize sparse observations and capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, it employs a prior-based heterogeneity smoothing strategy to correct unreliable learning caused by unevenly distributed trips, effectively modeling temporal variability under sparse and uneven data distributions. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SPTTE outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic methods by over 10.13%. Ablation studies and visualizations further confirm the effectiveness of the model components.</description>

Abstract: We provide a concrete and computable realization of the $ER=EPR$ conjecture, by deriving the Einstein-Rosen bridge from the quantum entanglement in the thermofield double CFT. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the wormhole is explicitly identified as an entanglement entropy between subsystems of the thermofield double state. Furthermore, our results provide a quantitative verification of Van Raamsdonk's conjecture about spacetime emergence.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Tur\'an number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The planar Tur\'an number of $k(k\geq 3)$ vertex-disjoint union of cycles is the trivial value $3n-6$. Lan, Shi and Song determined the exact value of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,2C_3)$. In this paper, we further research the existence of two disjoint cycles under distance restriction and get the planar Tur\'an number for $C_3\text{-}C_3$, where $C_{k}\text{-}C_{\ell}$ denotes the graph consisting of two disjoint cycles $C_k$ with an edge connecting them.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa and temperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. In this work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram, elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a significant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture in full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures and pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic self-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of CaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The phase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and increases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting for temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound as a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations on the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to explain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal conductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism, shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the standard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Seismic swarms unveil the mechanisms driving shallow slow slip dynamics in the Copiap\'o ridge, Northern Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like earthquakes, slow slip events release elastic energy stored on faults. Yet, the mechanisms behind slow slip instability and its relationship with seismicity are debated. Here, we use a seismo-geodetic deployment to document a shallow slow slip event (SSE) in 2023 on the Chile subduction. We observe dense, migrating seismic swarms accompanying the SSE, comprised of interface activity and upper plate splay faulting. Our observations suggest that the slow slip initiation is driven by structurally-confined fluid overpressure in the fluid-rich surroundings of a subducted seamount. This is consistent with an observed acceleration and expansion of the SSE after a $M_L=5.3$ earthquake likely triggering an increase in interface permeability. Historical earthquake swarms highlight the persistent structural control and recurrent nature of such slow slip events. Our observations provide insight into the interactions between slow slip and seismicity, suggesting they are controlled by creep on a fluid-infiltrated fault with fractally distributed asperities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a phase-field approximation for a model that describes the epitaxial growth of a thin film on a substrate in the context of linearized elasticity. The approximated model encodes a variable on the free surface of the film, that physically is interpreted with an adatom density. This collocates the model in the context of the crystal growth, beside being a mass constrained $\Gamma$-convergence result.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, representing a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the first example serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, featuring 1000 electrons and illustrating a metal-to-insulator transition, surpassing the largest calculations of strongly correlated electrons reported to date. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Linear Block Transform by Rate Distortion Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear block transform coding remains a fundamental component of image and video compression. Although the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely employed in all current compression standards, its sub-optimality has sparked ongoing research into discovering more efficient alternative transforms even for fields where it represents a consolidated tool. In this paper, we introduce a novel linear block transform called the Rate Distortion Learned Transform (RDLT), a data-driven transform specifically designed to minimize the rate-distortion (RD) cost when approximating residual blocks. Our approach builds on the latest end-to-end learned compression frameworks, adopting back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. However, unlike the nonlinear transforms used in variational autoencoder (VAE)-based methods, the goal is to create a simpler yet optimal linear block transform, ensuring practical integration into existing image and video compression standards. Differently from existing data-driven methods that design transforms based on sample covariance matrices, such as the Karhunen-Lo\`eve Transform (KLT), the proposed RDLT is directly optimized from an RD perspective. Experimental results show that this transform significantly outperforms the DCT or other existing data-driven transforms. Additionally, it is shown that when simulating the integration of our RDLT into a VVC-like image compression framework, the proposed transform brings substantial improvements. All the code used in our experiments has been made publicly available at [1].</description>

      <title>Preheating Axions in String Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Learning for Efficient Speech Separation with Many Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training speech separation models in the supervised setting raises a permutation problem: finding the best assignation between the model predictions and the ground truth separated signals. This inherently ambiguous task is customarily solved using Permutation Invariant Training (PIT). In this article, we instead consider using the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) framework, which was originally introduced to tackle ambiguous tasks. We demonstrate experimentally on the popular WSJ0-mix and LibriMix benchmarks that MCL matches the performances of PIT, while being computationally advantageous. This opens the door to a promising research direction, as MCL can be naturally extended to handle a variable number of speakers, or to tackle speech separation in the unsupervised setting.</description>

      <title>Collective decision making by embodied neural agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective decision making using simple social interactions has been studied in many types of multi-agent systems, including robot swarms and human social networks. However, existing multi-agent studies have rarely modeled the neural dynamics that underlie sensorimotor coordination in embodied biological agents. In this study, we investigated collective decisions that resulted from sensorimotor coordination among agents with simple neural dynamics. We equipped our agents with a model of minimal neural dynamics based on the coordination dynamics framework, and embedded them in an environment with a stimulus gradient. In our single-agent setup, the decision between two stimulus sources depends solely on the coordination of the agent's neural dynamics with its environment. In our multi-agent setup, that same decision also depends on the sensorimotor coordination between agents, via their simple social interactions. Our results show that the success of collective decisions depended on a balance of intra-agent, inter-agent, and agent-environment coupling, and we use these results to identify the influences of environmental factors on decision difficulty. More generally, our results demonstrate the impact of intra- and inter-brain coordination dynamics on collective behavior, can contribute to existing knowledge on the functional role of inter-agent synchrony, and are relevant to ongoing developments in neuro-AI and self-organized multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>GATE OpenING: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Judging Open-ended Interleaved Image-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in visual understanding and generation tasks. However, generating interleaved image-text content remains a challenge, which requires integrated multimodal understanding and generation abilities. While the progress in unified models offers new solutions, existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating these methods due to data size and diversity limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce GATE OpenING (OpenING), a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks. OpenING covers diverse daily scenarios such as travel guide, design, and brainstorming, offering a robust platform for challenging interleaved generation methods. In addition, we present IntJudge, a judge model for evaluating open-ended multimodal generation methods. Trained with a novel data pipeline, our IntJudge achieves an agreement rate of 82. 42% with human judgments, outperforming GPT-based evaluators by 11.34%. Extensive experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have substantial room for improvement. Key findings on interleaved image-text generation are further presented to guide the development of next-generation models. The OpenING is open-sourced at https://opening.github.io.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serious games and gamification (SGG) in eHealth have positive health impacts, but a personalized approach is needed due to diverse user contexts. This introduces challenges in achieving personalization in SGG. A literature search on Web of Science and PubMed identified 31 articles: 22 on serious games and 9 on gamification. These strategies are most applied in behavior change and rehabilitation, with machine learning and AI showing promise for personalization. Reusability of personalisation algorithms and domain knowledge is underemphasized, reported in only 10 articles. Future research should standardize personalized SGG development, focusing on component reuse to streamline design and enhance evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of some controllability issues for the forward stochastic heat equation with dynamic boundary conditions. The main novelty in the present paper consists of considering only one control without extra forces in the noise parts. Under a strong measurability condition, and using a spectral inequality, we first establish an appropriate observability inequality for the corresponding adjoint system. Then, by the classical duality approach, the null and approximate controllability results are established.</description>

Abstract: Isometry pursuit is a convex algorithm for identifying orthonormal column-submatrices of wide matrices. It consists of a novel normalization method followed by multitask basis pursuit. Applied to Jacobians of putative coordinate functions, it helps identity isometric embeddings from within interpretable dictionaries. We provide theoretical and experimental results justifying this method. For problems involving coordinate selection and diversification, it offers a synergistic alternative to greedy and brute force search.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Orchestration of Service-Oriented Model-Based Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel graph-based method for adapting control system architectures at runtime. We use a service-oriented architecture as a basis for its formulation. In our method, adaptation is achieved by selecting the most suitable elements, such as filters and controllers, for a control system architecture to improve control systems objective based on a predefined cost function. Traditional configuration methods, such as state machines, lack flexibility and depend on a predefined control system architecture during runtime. Our graph-based method allows for dynamic changes in the control system architecture, as well as a change in its objective depending on the given system state. Our approach uses a weighted, directed graph to model the control system elements and their interaction. In a case-study with a three-tank system, we show that by using our graph-based method for architecture adaptation, the control system is more flexible, has lower computation time, and higher accuracy than traditional configuration methods.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we examine the H\"older regularity of solutions to equations involving a mixed local-nonlocal nonlinear nonhomogeneous operator $(-\Delta)_{p} + (-\Delta)_{q}^{s}$, under the minimal assumption that $p&gt; sq$. The regularity result is twofold: we establish interior gradient H\"older regularity for locally bounded data and boundary regularity for singular data. We prove both boundary H\"older and gradient H\"older boundary regularity depending on the degree of singularity. Additionally, we establish a strong comparison principle for this class of problems, which holds independent significance. As the applications of these qualitative results, we further study sublinear and subcritical perturbations of singular nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>LLM-ABBA: Understand time series via symbolic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</description>

      <title>At First Contact: Stiffness Estimation Using Vibrational Information for Prosthetic Grasp Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stiffness estimation is crucial for delicate object manipulation in robotic and prosthetic hands but remains challenging due to dependence on force and displacement measurement and real-time sensory integration. This study presents a piezoelectric sensing framework for stiffness estimation at first contact during pinch grasps, addressing the limitations of traditional force-based methods. Inspired by human skin, a multimodal tactile sensor that captures vibrational and force data is developed and integrated into a prosthetic hand's fingertip. Machine learning models, including support vector machines and convolutional neural networks, demonstrate that vibrational signals within the critical 15 ms after first contact reliably encode stiffness, achieving classification accuracies up to 98.6\% and regression errors as low as 2.39 Shore A on real-world objects of varying stiffness. Inference times of less than 1.5 ms are significantly faster than the average grasp closure time (16.65 ms in our dataset), enabling real-time stiffness estimation before the object is fully grasped. By leveraging the transient asymmetry in grasp dynamics, where one finger contacts the object before the others, this method enables early grasp modulation, enhancing safety and intuitiveness in prosthetic hands while offering broad applications in robotics.</description>

      <title>Some rigidity results related to the Obata type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\Omega^{n+1},g)$ be an $(n + 1)$-dimensional smooth compact connected Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega=\Sigma$ and $f$ a smooth function on $\Omega$ which satisfies the Obata type equation $\nabla^2 f -fg =0$ with Robin boundary condition $f_{\nu} = cf$, where $c=\coth{\theta}&gt;1$. In this paper, we consider the rigidity of $\Omega$. First, we derive the warped product structure of $\Omega$ by the properties of the Obata type equation and the set $\Omega_0=\{x\in \Omega ~|~ f(x)=0\}$. Second, we determine the specific structure of $\Omega_0$ under appropriate curvature assumptions and provide the structure of $\Omega$ accordingly.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

      <title>A subgroup-aware scoring approach to the study of effect modification in observational studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effect modification means the size of a treatment effect varies with an observed covariate. Generally speaking, a larger treatment effect with more stable error terms is less sensitive to bias. Thus, we might be able to conclude that a study is less sensitive to unmeasured bias by using these subgroups experiencing larger treatment effects. Lee et al. (2018) proposed the submax method that leverages the joint distribution of test statistics from subgroups to draw a firmer conclusion if effect modification occurs. However, one version of the submax method uses M-statistics as the test statistics and is implemented in the R package submax (Rosenbaum, 2017). The scaling factor in the M-statistics is computed using all observations combined across subgroups. We show that this combining can confuse effect modification with outliers. We propose a novel group M-statistic that scores the matched pairs in each subgroup to tackle the issue. We examine our novel scoring strategy in extensive settings to show the superior performance. The proposed method is applied to an observational study of the effect of a malaria prevention treatment in West Africa.</description>

Abstract: HiRep allows flexible simulations of higher representations of Wilson Fermions with various actions and gauge groups and a range of inverters and integrators. This is particularly important for enabling evaluations of observables relevant to phenomenological inputs for Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics from lattice field theory.

      <title>Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultra-strong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhance the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and imposes a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade and quantum information processing in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing weed detection performance by means of GenAI-based image augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise weed management is essential for sustaining crop productivity and ecological balance. Traditional herbicide applications face economic and environmental challenges, emphasizing the need for intelligent weed control systems powered by deep learning. These systems require vast amounts of high-quality training data. The reality of scarcity of well-annotated training data, however, is often addressed through generating more data using data augmentation. Nevertheless, conventional augmentation techniques such as random flipping, color changes, and blurring lack sufficient fidelity and diversity. This paper investigates a generative AI-based augmentation technique that uses the Stable Diffusion model to produce diverse synthetic images that improve the quantity and quality of training datasets for weed detection models. Moreover, this paper explores the impact of these synthetic images on the performance of real-time detection systems, thus focusing on compact CNN-based models such as YOLO nano for edge devices. The experimental results show substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP50 and mAP50-95) scores for YOLO models trained with generative AI-augmented datasets, demonstrating the promising potential of synthetic data to enhance model robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Holographic Timelike Entanglement Entropy in Non-relativistic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timelike entanglement entropy is a complex measure of information that is holographically realized by an appropriate combination of spacelike and timelike extremal surfaces. This measure is highly sensitive to Lorentz invariance breaking. In this work, we study the timelike entanglement entropy in non-relativistic theories, focusing on theories with hyperscaling violation and Lifshitz-like spatial anisotropy. The properties of the extremal surfaces, as well as the timelike entanglement entropy itself, depend heavily on the symmetry-breaking parameters of the theory. Consequently, we show that timelike entanglement can encode, to a large extent, the stability and naturalness of the theory. Furthermore, we find that timelike entanglement entropy identifies Fermi surfaces either through the logarithmic behavior of its real part or, alternatively, via its constant imaginary part, with this constant value depending on the theory's Lifshitz exponent. This provides a novel interpretation for the imaginary component of this pseudoentropy. Additionally, we examine temporal entanglement entropy, an extension of timelike entanglement entropy to Euclidean space, and provide a comprehensive discussion of its properties in these theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental identification of magnetic compounds consisting of zigzag chains, we analyze the band structure topology of magnons in ferromagnets on a zigzag lattice. We account for the general lattice geometry by including spatially anisotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions and by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on inversion asymmetric bonds. Within the linear spin-wave theory, we find two magnon branches, whose band structure topology (i.e., Chern numbers) we map out in a comprehensive phase diagram. Notably, besides topologically trivial and gapless phases, we identify topologically nontrivial phases that support chiral edge magnons. We show that these edge states are robust against elastic defect scattering.</description>

      <title>Living off the Analyst: Harvesting Features from Yara Rules for Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strategy used by malicious actors is to "live off the land," where benign systems and tools already available on a victim's systems are used and repurposed for the malicious actor's intent. In this work, we ask if there is a way for anti-virus developers to similarly re-purpose existing work to improve their malware detection capability. We show that this is plausible via YARA rules, which use human-written signatures to detect specific malware families, functionalities, or other markers of interest. By extracting sub-signatures from publicly available YARA rules, we assembled a set of features that can more effectively discriminate malicious samples from benign ones. Our experiments demonstrate that these features add value beyond traditional features on the EMBER 2018 dataset. Manual analysis of the added sub-signatures shows a power-law behavior in a combination of features that are specific and unique, as well as features that occur often. A prior expectation may be that the features would be limited in being overly specific to unique malware families. This behavior is observed, and is apparently useful in practice. In addition, we also find sub-signatures that are dual-purpose (e.g., detecting virtual machine environments) or broadly generic (e.g., DLL imports).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores displaced fermionic Gaussian operators with nonzero linear terms. We first demonstrate equivalence between several characterizations of displaced Gaussian states. We also provide an efficient classical simulation protocol for displaced Gaussian circuits and demonstrate their computational equivalence to circuits composed of nearest-neighbor matchgates augmented by single-qubit gates on the initial line. Finally, we construct a novel Gaussianity-preserving unitary embedding that maps $n$-qubit displaced Gaussian states to $(n+1)$-qubit even Gaussian states. This embedding facilitates the generalization of existing Gaussian testing protocols to displaced Gaussian states and unitaries. Our results provide new tools to analyze fermionic systems beyond the constraints of parity super-selection, extending the theoretical understanding and practical simulation of fermionic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid properties of the kagome material Cu$_3$(HOTP)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal-organic-framework (MOF) compound Cu$_3$(HOTP)$_2$, a.k.a. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$, is a small-gap semiconductor containing a kagome lattice of antiferromagnetically coupled $S$=1/2 Cu$^\mathrm{II}$ spins with intra-layer nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J \sim $ 2 K. The intra-layer $J$ value obtained from DFT+U calculations is shown to match with the experimental value for reasonable values of U. Muon spin relaxation confirms no magnetic ordering down to 50~mK and sees spin fluctuations diffusing on a 2D lattice, consistent with a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state being present within highly decoupled kagome layers. Reduction of the spin diffusion rate on cooling from the paramagnetic region to the low-temperature QSL region reflects quantum entanglement. It is also found that the layers become more strongly decoupled in the low-temperature QSL region. Comparison of results for the spin diffusion, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat in the QSL region suggests close proximity to a quantum critical point and a large density of low energy spinless electronic excitations. A Z$_2$-linear Dirac model for the spin excitations of the QSL is found to provide the best match with experiment.</description>

      <title>A Talent-infused Policy-gradient Approach to Efficient Co-Design of Morphology and Task Allocation Behavior of Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interesting and efficient collective behavior observed in multi-robot or swarm systems emerges from the individual behavior of the robots. The functional space of individual robot behaviors is in turn shaped or constrained by the robot's morphology or physical design. Thus the full potential of multi-robot systems can be realized by concurrently optimizing the morphology and behavior of individual robots, informed by the environment's feedback about their collective performance, as opposed to treating morphology and behavior choices disparately or in sequence (the classical approach). This paper presents an efficient concurrent design or co-design method to explore this potential and understand how morphology choices impact collective behavior, particularly in an MRTA problem focused on a flood response scenario, where the individual behavior is designed via graph reinforcement learning. Computational efficiency in this case is attributed to a new way of near exact decomposition of the co-design problem into a series of simpler optimization and learning problems. This is achieved through i) the identification and use of the Pareto front of Talent metrics that represent morphology-dependent robot capabilities, and ii) learning the selection of Talent best trade-offs and individual robot policy that jointly maximizes the MRTA performance. Applied to a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle flood response use case, the co-design outcomes are shown to readily outperform sequential design baselines. Significant differences in morphology and learned behavior are also observed when comparing co-designed single robot vs. co-designed multi-robot systems for similar operations.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Ontology based Graph Attention Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, graph representation learning has undergone a paradigm shift, driven by the emergence and proliferation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their heterogeneous counterparts. Heterogeneous GNNs have shown remarkable success in extracting low-dimensional embeddings from complex graphs that encompass diverse entity types and relationships. While meta-path-based techniques have long been recognized for their ability to capture semantic affinities among nodes, their dependence on manual specification poses a significant limitation. In contrast, matrix-focused methods accelerate processing by utilizing structural cues but often overlook contextual richness. In this paper, we challenge the current paradigm by introducing ontology as a fundamental semantic primitive within complex graphs. Our goal is to integrate the strengths of both matrix-centric and meta-path-based approaches into a unified framework. We propose perturbation Ontology-based Graph Attention Networks (POGAT), a novel methodology that combines ontology subgraphs with an advanced self-supervised learning paradigm to achieve a deep contextual understanding. The core innovation of POGAT lies in our enhanced homogeneous perturbing scheme designed to generate rigorous negative samples, encouraging the model to explore minimal contextual features more thoroughly. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that POGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a groundbreaking improvement of up to 10.78\% in F1-score for the critical task of link prediction and 12.01\% in Micro-F1 for the critical task of node classification.</description>

      <title>Towards Motion Compensation in Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, typically treated with intravitreal injections. Emerging therapies, such as subretinal injections of stem cells, gene therapy, small molecules or RPE cells require precise delivery to avoid damaging delicate retinal structures. Autonomous robotic systems can potentially offer the necessary precision for these procedures. This paper presents a novel approach for motion compensation in robotic subretinal injections, utilizing real-time Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The proposed method leverages B$^{5}$-scans, a rapid acquisition of small-volume OCT data, for dynamic tracking of retinal motion along the Z-axis, compensating for physiological movements such as breathing and heartbeat. Validation experiments on \textit{ex vivo} porcine eyes revealed challenges in maintaining a consistent tool-to-retina distance, with deviations of up to 200 $\mu m$ for 100 $\mu m$ amplitude motions and over 80 $\mu m$ for 25 $\mu m$ amplitude motions over one minute. Subretinal injections faced additional difficulties, with horizontal shifts causing the needle to move off-target and inject into the vitreous. These results highlight the need for improved motion prediction and horizontal stability to enhance the accuracy and safety of robotic subretinal procedures.</description>

      <title>CAPMAP: A New Instrument to Measure the E-mode CMB Polarization on Angular Scales of 4 arcmin to 40 arcmin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CMB polarization is the Everest in the quest to characterize the earliest photons from the Universe. After a long list of ever-decreasing upper limits, a detection of polarization was made in 2002 by the DASI team at ell =~ 500. The experiment described in this thesis is designed to make a more detailed measurements at higher angular resolution. The E-mode polarization power spectrum not only provides a more direct link to the properties of the last scattering surface than the temperature anisotropy but also offers complementary information which can be used to break various degeneracies in the determination of cosmological parameters. Most importantly, the existence of polarization is a robust prediction of the standard cosmological picture so a precise measurement of the CMB polarization should come as a confirmation of the standard model. However, polarization measurements represent an experimental challenge. The weakness of the polarization signal requires both a demanding instrumental sensitivity and focused attention to all sources of systematic error. This thesis describes the design, construction, and testing of a 90 GHz four-element array of correlation polarimeters to probe the E-mode polarization power spectrum at multipoles (ell) ranging from 500 to 1500. The array was fielded in Jan 2003 on the 7-meter Crawford Hill antenna, in Holmdel, New Jersey and observed for two months. The receiver calibration is described in detail, as well as the characterization of the pointing and beams. Preliminary analysis indicates that the instrument is sufficiently sensitive to detect the few micro Kelvin signal of the CMB polarization.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal BD-RIS in Full-duplex Communications: A Perspective on Sum-rate Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS, beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by non-reciprocal circuits and thus has asymmetric scattering matrix. This feature provides probability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and thus has potential to benefit the full-duplex (FD) system. In this paper, we model the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and that of structural scattering, which refers to the virtual direct channel constructed by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To visualize the analysis, we propose to design the scattering matrix, precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that it can achieve higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>The Solvay Councils, de Broglie's brothers, and the development of wave-particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meeting patronized by Ernest Solvay in 1911, the first Solvay Council, marked the beginning of what can be called the first quantum revolution. Maurice de Broglie was one of the secretaries of the Council. He participated in the two following conferences and contributed to the third Council with his work. Louis de Broglie collaborated and discussed with his elder brother. Departing from Maurice's achievements, Louis developed his approach to the wave-particle duality of light and extended it to other particles. He presented it at the fifth meeting in 1927. This paper investigates the connection between the two scientists and the Solvay Councils, arguing that this link was essential in developing the first quantum revolution, a process that ended, according to Werner Heisenberg, at the fifth Solvay Physics Council.</description>

      <title>Renormalized one-Loop Corrections in Power Spectrum in USR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of one-loop corrections on long CMB scale modes in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase is under debate. In this work, we investigate the regularization and renormalization of the one-loop corrections of curvature perturbation power spectrum. Employing the UV-IR regularizations and performing the in-in analysis, we calculate the regularized one-loop corrections, including tadpole, in the power spectrum associated with cubic and quartic Hamiltonians. We show that the fully regularized and renormalized fractional loop correction in the power spectrum is controlled by the peak of the power spectrum at the end of USR phase, scaling like $ e^{6 \Delta {\cal N}}$ in which $\Delta {\cal N} $ is the duration of the USR phase. This confirms the original conclusion that the loop corrections can get out of perturbative control if the transition from the intermediate USR phase to the final SR phase is instantaneous and sharp.</description>

      <title>NeuroAI for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</description>

      <title>Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen kinetic exchange opinion model for two connected groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a kinetic model of opinion dynamics known as the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen model with a modular interaction structure. The system consists of two groups of agents that feature more frequent interactions within each group and rarer interactions between agents of different groups. We use the mean-field analytical approximation to determine that aside from previously known ordered and disordered states, a new antisymmetric ordered state is stable, where each group has an opposite dominant opinion. The limits of system interaction strength and noise for the stability of such a state are determined, with a discontinuous transition from an antisymmetric to a symmetric state happening if thresholds are exceeded. The results of numerical agent-based simulations confirm our analytical predictions and show that the critical values of noise and interaction strength are predicted with good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Self-Identity in AI: A Mathematical Framework and Empirical Study with Generative Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a mathematical framework for defining and quantifying self-identity in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, addressing a critical gap in the theoretical foundations of artificial consciousness. While existing approaches to artificial self-awareness often rely on heuristic implementations or philosophical abstractions, we present a formal framework grounded in metric space theory, measure theory, and functional analysis. Our framework posits that self-identity emerges from two mathematically quantifiable conditions: the existence of a connected continuum of memories $C \subseteq \mathcal{M}$ in a metric space $(\mathcal{M}, d_{\mathcal{M}})$, and a continuous mapping $I: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{S}$ that maintains consistent self-recognition across this continuum, where $(\mathcal{S}, d_{\mathcal{S}})$ represents the metric space of possible self-identities. To validate this theoretical framework, we conducted empirical experiments using the Llama 3.2 1B model, employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model was trained on a synthetic dataset containing temporally structured memories, designed to capture the complexity of coherent self-identity formation. Our evaluation metrics included quantitative measures of self-awareness, response consistency, and linguistic precision. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in measurable self-awareness metrics, with the primary self-awareness score increasing from 0.276 to 0.801. This enables the structured creation of AI systems with validated self-identity features. The implications of our study are immediately relevant to the fields of humanoid robotics and autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a privacy measure called statistic maximal leakage that quantifies how much a privacy mechanism leaks about a specific secret, relative to the adversary's prior information about that secret. Statistic maximal leakage is an extension of the well-known maximal leakage. Unlike maximal leakage, which protects an arbitrary, unknown secret, statistic maximal leakage protects a single, known secret. We show that statistic maximal leakage satisfies composition and post-processing properties. Additionally, we show how to efficiently compute it in the special case of deterministic data release mechanisms. We analyze two important mechanisms under statistic maximal leakage: the quantization mechanism and randomized response. We show theoretically and empirically that the quantization mechanism achieves better privacy-utility tradeoffs in the settings we study.</description>

We study the local and global well-posedness on a bounded domain and the whole Euclidean space in the energy space. Then, we consider the solutions' asymptotic behavior. We prove strong convergence to a stationary state and asymptotic convergence to the ground state in bounded domains when the initial condition is positive.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Mean Teacher with Supcontrast Loss for Wafer Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The patterns on wafer maps play a crucial role in helping engineers identify the causes of production issues during semiconductor manufacturing. In order to reduce costs and improve accuracy, automation technology is essential, and recent developments in deep learning have led to impressive results in wafer map pattern recognition. In this context, inspired by the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning methods, we introduce an innovative approach that integrates the Mean Teacher framework with the supervised contrastive learning loss for enhanced wafer map pattern recognition. Our methodology not only addresses the nuances of wafer patterns but also tackles challenges arising from limited labeled data. To further refine the process, we address data imbalance in the wafer dataset by employing SMOTE and under-sampling techniques. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments using real-world dataset WM811K obtained from semiconductor manufacturers. Compared to the baseline method, our method has achieved 5.46%, 6.68%, 5.42%, and 4.53% improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We study partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have bounded derived length, proving the following three theorems. In every solvable permutation group, there is a subset whose setwise stabilizer has derived length at most $3$, which is best possible. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length bounded by an absolute constant. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose pointwise stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Ground-State Preparation of the Fermi-Hubbard Model on a Quantum Computer with 2D Topology via Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense promise for simulating quantum systems, a critical task for advancing our understanding of complex quantum phenomena. One of the primary goals in this domain is to accurately approximate the ground state of quantum systems. The Fermi-Hubbard model, particularly, is of profound interest due to its implications for high-temperature superconductivity and strongly correlated electron systems. The quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices (QETU) algorithm offers a novel approach for ground state estimation by utilizing a controlled Hamiltonian time evolution operator, circumventing the resource-intensive block-encoding required by previous methods. In this work, we apply the QETU algorithm to the $2 \times 2$ Fermi-Hubbard model, presenting circuit simplifications tailored to the model and introducing a mapping to a 9-qubit grid-like hardware architecture inspired by fermionic swap networks. We investigate how the selection of a favorable hardware architecture can benefit the circuit construction. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of this method under the influence of noise, focusing on its robustness and practical applicability.</description>

Abstract: $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$, a structural-analogue to the iron-based parent compound $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$, offers a unique platform to study the interplay between superconductivity, charge density waves and, possibly, electronic nematicity. Here, we report on the growth and characterization of $\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ca}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ single crystals with $0 \leq x \leq 0.1$, using a combination of x-ray diffraction, diffuse x-ray scattering, heat capacity, and electronic transport measurements. Our results demonstrate that calcium substitution affects the structural, electronic and thermodynamic properties of $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ in a way that is strongly reminiscent of moderate hydrostatic pressures albeit with marked differences. In particular Ca-substitution efficiently suppresses both the triclinic structural transition and the associated commensurate charge density wave formation, while increasing the superconducting transition temperature. We found that the substitution range in which the crystals remain homogeneous is limited as for concentrations $x \geq 0.04$ intense diffuse x-ray scattering indicates the formation of stacking faults, which, despite the preserved integrity of the NiAs layers, prevents investigation up to concentrations at which the chemical pressure would completely suppress the structural instability.</description>

      <title>Interstitial Solute Segregation at Triple Junctions: Implications for the Hydrogen Storage Properties of Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At very fine grain sizes, grain boundary segregation can deviate from conventional behavior due to triple junction effects. While this issue has been addressed in prior work for substitutional alloys, here we develop a framework that accounts for interstitial sites in the grains, grain boundaries, and triple junctions of model Pd(H) polycrystals. This approach allows computation of interstitial segregation spectra separately at both defect types, which permits an understanding of segregation at all grain sizes via a size-scaling spectral isotherm. The size dependencies of dilute Pd(H) are found to be influenced not only by the triple junction content, but also by grain size-dependent lattice strains; the latter effect is evidenced by size dependencies of individual grain boundary and junction subspectra. The framework proposed here is applicable to interstitial alloys in general, and may serve as a basis for interfacial engineering in interstitial nanocrystalline alloys. As an example, we show using the dilute limit isotherm that hydrogen density can triple in nanocrystalline vis-\`a-vis microcrystalline Pd due to hydrogen adsorption at intergranular defect sites.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Hadamard spaces and the equivariant coarse Novikov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equivariant coarse Novikov conjectures for spaces that equivariantly and coarsely embed into admissible Hilbert-Hadamard spaces, which are a type of infinite-dimensional nonpositively curved spaces. The paper is split into two parts. We prove in the first part that for any metric space $X$ with bounded geometry and with a proper isometric action $\alpha$ by a countable discrete group $\Gamma$, if $X$ admits an equivariant coarse embedding into an admissible Hilbert-Hadamard space and $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, then the equivariant coarse strong Novikov conjecture holds rationally for $(X, \Gamma, \alpha)$.
  In the second part, we drop the torsion-free assumption for $\Gamma$ in the first part. We introduce a Miscenko-Kasparov assembly map for a proper $\Gamma$-space $X$ with equivariant bounded geometry, which leads to a new Novikov-type conjecture that we call the analytic equivariant coarse Novikov conjecture. We show that for a proper $\Gamma$-space $X$ with equivariant bounded geometry, the rational analytic equivariant coarse Novikov conjecture holds for $(X,\Gamma,\alpha)$ if $X$ admits an equivariant coarse embedding into an admissible Hilbert-Hadamard space, i.e., the Miscenko-Kasparov assembly map is a rational injection.</description>

      <title>AdaVLN: Towards Visual Language Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments with Moving Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Language Navigation is a task that challenges robots to navigate in realistic environments based on natural language instructions. While previous research has largely focused on static settings, real-world navigation must often contend with dynamic human obstacles. Hence, we propose an extension to the task, termed Adaptive Visual Language Navigation (AdaVLN), which seeks to narrow this gap. AdaVLN requires robots to navigate complex 3D indoor environments populated with dynamically moving human obstacles, adding a layer of complexity to navigation tasks that mimic the real-world. To support exploration of this task, we also present AdaVLN simulator and AdaR2R datasets. The AdaVLN simulator enables easy inclusion of fully animated human models directly into common datasets like Matterport3D. We also introduce a "freeze-time" mechanism for both the navigation task and simulator, which pauses world state updates during agent inference, enabling fair comparisons and experimental reproducibility across different hardware. We evaluate several baseline models on this task, analyze the unique challenges introduced by AdaVLN, and demonstrate its potential to bridge the sim-to-real gap in VLN research.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tuned superconducting and normal phase magnetism in CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By tuning superconductivity with an applied magnetic field, we use neutrons to compare the magnetic ordered phases in superconducting and normal states of CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$. At zero field, CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$ displays both superconductivity ($T_{c}$=1.3 K) and spatially long-ranged commensurate $\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\downarrow$ antiferromagnetism ($T_{N}$=2.5 K, $\vec{Q}_{0}=({1\over 2}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 2})$). Neutron spectroscopy fails to measure propagating magnetic excitations with only temporally overdamped fluctuations observable. On applying a magnetic field we find anisotropic behavior in the static magnetism. When the field is along the crystallographic $c$-axis, no change in the static magnetic response is observable. However when the field is oriented within the $a-b$ plane, an increase in $T_{N}$ and change in the critical response are measured. At low temperatures in the superconducting phase, the elastic magnetic intensity increases linearly ($\propto |H|$) with small $a-b$ oriented fields. However, this trend is interrupted at intermediate fields where commensurate block $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ magnetism with propagation vector $\vec{Q}=({1\over 2}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 4})$ forms. For large applied fields in the [1 $\overline{1}$ 0] direction which completely suppresses superconductivity, weakly incommensurate magnetic order along $L$ is observed to replace the commensurate response present in the superconducting and vortex phases. We suggest field-induced incommensurate static magnetism, present in the normal state of superconducting and antiferromagnetic CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$ for $a-b$ plane oriented magnetic fields. We speculate that these field dependent properties are tied to the field induced anisotropy associated with the local Ce$^{3+}$ crystal field environment of the tetragonal `115' structure.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of Ideas' Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of contemporary society, the popularity of ideas, opinions, and interests fluctuates rapidly. Traditional dynamical models in social sciences often fail to capture this inherent volatility, attributing changes to exogenous shocks rather than intrinsic features of the system. This paper introduces a novel, tractable model that simulates the natural rise and fall of ideas' popularity, offering a more accurate representation of real-world dynamics. Building upon the SIRS (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered, Susceptible) epidemiological model, we incorporate a feedback mechanism that allows the recovery rate to vary dynamically based on the current state of the system. This modification reflects the cyclical nature of idea adoption and abandonment, driven by social saturation and renewed interest. Our model successfully captures the rapid and recurrent shifts in popularity, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms behind these fluctuations. This approach offers a robust framework for studying the diffusion dynamics of popular ideas, with potential applications across various fields such as marketing, technology adoption, and political movements.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. Our findings reveal that the Fermi surface evolves smoothly with doping. Notably, the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, while nodal quasiparticle coherence increases monotonously. This demonstrates that the sharp increase in Hall carrier density recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1596 (2024)] cannot be attributed to the closure of the pseudogap. Further, we determine a temperature boundary of the pseudogap of $T^{*}\simeq~200~\textrm{K}$ for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates. Our results suggest that pseudogaps are a generic feature of doped quasi-2D antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, likely related to short range magnetic correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical scattering by macroscopic lossy objects: A general approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general approach to describe the scattering of quantum light by a lossy macroscopic object placed in vacuum with no restrictions on both its dispersive optical response and its spatially inhomogeneous composition. Our analysis is based on the modified Langevin noise formalism, a recently introduced version of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics where scattering (s) modes are explicitly separated from electric (e) and magnetic (m) medium excitations; accordingly the formalism involves three kinds of non-interacting boson polaritons such that, in the lossless limit, s-polaritons reduce to standard photons whereas e- and m-polaritons disappear. We analytically derive the input-output unitary relation joining the boson operators of the ingoing and outgoing polaritons, a nontrivial result hinging upon original relations which comprehensively describe the transmission-emission-absorption interplay pertaining the classical radiation scattering, relations we here deduce by resorting to the dyadic Green's function properties. Besides we exploit the input-output relation to connect the output state of the field to the input one, this unveiling the role played by various classical electromagnetic dyadics in quantum optical scattering. We specialize the discussion to the most common situation where the object is initially not electromagnetically excited, with the ingoing electromagnetic state only containing s-polaritons, and we analyze the impact of the classical transmission and absorption dyadics on the transitions from ingoing to outgoing s-polariton and on the creation of outgoing e- and m-polaritons, respectively. Since the scattered radiation is collected in the far-field and the object is usually left unmeasured, we analytically derive the reduced density operator of the outgoing s-polaritons.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have been objects of great interest for the past few decades due to their unusually high luminosities and spectral properties. A few of these sources exhibit super-Eddington luminosities assuming them to be centering around stellar mass objects, even in their hard state. It has been shown via numerical steady state calculations that ULXs in hard state can be interpreted as highly magnetised advective accretion sources around stellar mass black holes. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) framework to simulate highly magnetised advective accretion flows around a black hole and show that such systems can indeed produce high luminosities like ULXs. We also verify that the magnetic fields required for such high emissions is around $10^7$ G, in accordance with previous numerical steady state calculations. We further present power profiles for zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO) frame. These profiles show interesting features which can be interpreted as effects of emission due to the Blandford-Znajek and Blandford-Payne mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: The definition of the homotopy limit of a diagram of left Quillen functors of model categories has been useful in a number of applications. In this paper we review its definition and summarize some of these applications. We conclude with a discussion of why we could work with right Quillen functors instead, but cannot work with a combination of the two.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important property of neutron scattering data is that they can be normalised in absolute intensity units. In practice, however, such normalisation is often not performed, since it can be time-consuming and subject to systematic uncertainties. Here, a straightforward approach is presented for absolute intensity normalisation of neutron scattering data from polycrystalline samples. This approach uses the intensity scale factor obtained from a Rietveld refinement to normalise the data to the nuclear Bragg profile of the sample. Factors to convert the Rietveld scale factor into an absolute normalisation factor are tabulated for constant-wavelength and time-of-flight data refined using the popular programs Fullprof and GSAS-II. An example of the application of this method to experimental data is presented. Advantages, disadvantages, and extensions of this approach to spectroscopic data are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PhyCAGE, the first approach for physically plausible compositional 3D asset generation from a single image. Given an input image, we first generate consistent multi-view images for components of the assets. These images are then fitted with 3D Gaussian Splatting representations. To ensure that the Gaussians representing objects are physically compatible with each other, we introduce a Physical Simulation-Enhanced Score Distillation Sampling (PSE-SDS) technique to further optimize the positions of the Gaussians. It is achieved by setting the gradient of the SDS loss as the initial velocity of the physical simulation, allowing the simulator to act as a physics-guided optimizer that progressively corrects the Gaussians' positions to a physically compatible state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate physically plausible compositional 3D assets given a single image.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider Bowley's skewness measure and the Groeneveld-Meeden $b_{3}$ index in the context of finite population sampling. We employ the functional delta method to obtain asymptotic variance formulae for plug-in estimators and propose corresponding variance estimators. We then consider plug-in estimators based on the H\'{a}jek cdf-estimator and on a Deville-S\"arndal type calibration estimator and test the performance of normal confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Universality for random matrices with an edge spectrum singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study invariant random matrix ensembles \begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{P}_n(d M)=Z_n^{-1}\exp(-n\,tr(V(M)))\,d M \end{equation*} defined on complex Hermitian matrices $M$ of size $n\times n$, where $V$ is real analytic such that the underlying density of states is one-cut regular. Considering the average \begin{equation*}
  E_n[\phi;\lambda,\alpha,\beta]:=\mathbb{E}_n\bigg(\prod_{\ell=1}^n\big(1-\phi(\lambda_{\ell}(M))\big)\omega_{\alpha\beta}(\lambda_{\ell}(M)-\lambda)\bigg),\ \ \ \ \ \omega_{\alpha\beta}(x):=|x|^{\alpha}\begin{cases}1,&amp;x&lt;0\\ \beta,&amp;x\geq 0\end{cases}, \end{equation*} taken with respect to the above law and where $\phi$ is a suitable test function, we evaluate its large-$n$ asymptotic assuming that $\lambda$ lies within the soft edge boundary layer, and $(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{C}$ satisfy $\alpha&gt;-1,\beta\notin(-\infty,0)$. Our results are obtained by using Riemann-Hilbert problems for orthogonal polynomials and integrable operators and they extend previous results of Forrester and Witte \cite{FW} that were obtained by an application of Okamoto's $\tau$-function theory. A key role throughout is played by distinguished solutions to the Painlev\'e-XXXIV equation.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Cumulative Reward in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concentration properties of cumulative rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on both asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We introduce a unified approach to characterize reward concentration in MDPs, covering both infinite-horizon settings (i.e., average and discounted reward frameworks) and finite-horizon setting. Our asymptotic results include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of iterated logarithms, while our non-asymptotic bounds include Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities and a non-asymptotic version of the law of iterated logarithms. Additionally, we explore two key implications of our results. First, we analyze the sample path behavior of the difference in rewards between any two stationary policies. Second, we show that two alternative definitions of regret for learning policies proposed in the literature are rate-equivalent. Our proof techniques rely on a novel martingale decomposition of cumulative rewards, properties of the solution to the policy evaluation fixed-point equation, and both asymptotic and non-asymptotic concentration results for martingale difference sequences.</description>

      <title>FAM Diffusion: Frequency and Attention Modulation for High-Resolution Image Generation with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are proficient at generating high-quality images. They are however effective only when operating at the resolution used during training. Inference at a scaled resolution leads to repetitive patterns and structural distortions. Retraining at higher resolutions quickly becomes prohibitive. Thus, methods enabling pre-existing diffusion models to operate at flexible test-time resolutions are highly desirable. Previous works suffer from frequent artifacts and often introduce large latency overheads. We propose two simple modules that combine to solve these issues. We introduce a Frequency Modulation (FM) module that leverages the Fourier domain to improve the global structure consistency, and an Attention Modulation (AM) module which improves the consistency of local texture patterns, a problem largely ignored in prior works. Our method, coined Fam diffusion, can seamlessly integrate into any latent diffusion model and requires no additional training. Extensive qualitative results highlight the effectiveness of our method in addressing structural and local artifacts, while quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance. Also, our method avoids redundant inference tricks for improved consistency such as patch-based or progressive generation, leading to negligible latency overheads.</description>

      <title>Retrofitting (Large) Language Models with Dynamic Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current language models (LMs) use a fixed, static subword tokenizer. This choice, often taken for granted, typically results in degraded efficiency and capabilities in languages other than English, and makes it challenging to apply LMs to new domains or languages. To address these issues, we propose retrofitting LMs with dynamic tokenization: a way to dynamically decide on token boundaries based on the input text. For encoder-style models, we introduce a subword-merging algorithm inspired by byte-pair encoding (BPE), but at a batch level. We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pretrained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. When applied with word-level boundaries, this on average reduces token sequence lengths by &gt;20% across 14 languages on XNLI with XLM-R while degrading its task performance by less than 2%. For decoder-style models, we apply dynamic tokenization in two ways: 1) for prefilling, maintaining performance of Mistral-7B almost completely with up to 40% sequence reduction - relative to the word-level; and 2) via an approximate nearest neighbor index, achieving fast generation with a one million token vocabulary, demonstrating scalability to even larger, dynamic vocabularies. Overall, our findings show that dynamic tokenization substantially improves inference speed and promotes fairness across languages, making a leap towards overcoming the limitations of static tokenization and enabling more equitable and adaptable LMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the action of an autoequivalence, the spherical twist associated to a torsion sheaf, on the standard Bridgeland stability conditions and a generalized weak stability condition on the derived category of a K3 surface. As a special case, we construct a Bridgeland stability condition associated to a non-nef divisor, which conjecturally lies in the geometric component but outside the geometric chamber. We also discuss the destabilizing objects and stability of certain line bundles at the weak stability condition associated to a nef divisor.</description>

      <title>A characterization of mutual absolute continuity of probability measures on a filtered space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new characterization for mutual absolute continuity of probability measures on a filtered space. For this, we introduce a martingale limit $M$ that measures the similarity between the tails of the probability measures restricted to the filtration. The measures are mutually absolutely continuous if and only if $M = 1$ holds almost surely for both measures. In this case, the square roots of the Radon-Nikodym derivatives on the filtration converge in $L^2$. Finally, we apply the result to families of random variables and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-driven Phononic Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons are quasi-particles associated with mechanical vibrations in materials, at the root of the propagation of sound, elastic / mechanical waves, and of thermal phenomena, common to our every day life and many technologies. The fundamental understanding and control over phonon responses in natural and artificial media is of major importance in the context of telecommunications, shielding, energy harvesting and control, sensing and imaging, across multiple scales. In this context, it has been recently realized that controlling different classes of symmetries at the microscopic and mesoscopic scale offers a powerful rational tool to precisely tailor phononic responses, leading to advanced acoustic and elastodynamic wave control. In this paper, we review the recent advances in the design and synthesis of artificial phononic media, namely phononic metamaterials, guided by symmetry principles. Starting from tailored broken spatial symmetries, we discuss their interplay with time symmetries for non-reciprocity and non-conservative phenomena, and finally address broader concepts that combine multiple symmetry classes to support exotic phononic wave transport.</description>

      <title>High-throughput antibody screening with high-quality factor nanophotonics and bioprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical investigation of the quintillion-scale, functionally diverse antibody repertoires that can be generated synthetically or naturally is critical for identifying potential biotherapeutic leads, yet remains burdensome. We present high-throughput nanophotonics- and bioprinter-enabled screening (HT-NaBS), a multiplexed assay for large-scale, sample-efficient, and rapid characterization of antibody libraries. Our platform is built upon independently addressable pixelated nanoantennas exhibiting wavelength-scale mode volumes, high-quality factors (high-Q) exceeding 5000, and pattern densities exceeding one million sensors per square centimeter. Our custom-built acoustic bioprinter enables individual sensor functionalization via the deposition of picoliter droplets from a library of capture antigens at rates up to 25,000 droplets per second. We detect subtle differentiation in the target binding signature through spatially-resolved spectral imaging of hundreds of resonators simultaneously, elucidating antigen-antibody binding kinetic rates, affinity constant, and specificity. We demonstrate HT-NaBS on a panel of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B antigens, with a sub-picomolar limit of detection within 30 minutes. Furthermore, through epitope binning analysis, we demonstrate the competence and diversity of a library of native antibodies targeting functional epitopes on a priority pathogen (H5N1 bird flu) and on glycosylated therapeutic Cetuximab antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor. With a roadmap to image tens of thousands of sensors simultaneously, this high-throughput, resource-efficient, and label-free platform can rapidly screen for high-affinity and broad epitope coverage, accelerating biotherapeutic discovery and de novo protein design.</description>

      <title>Influence of gravity on the quantum speed limit in neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee cosmology: Tests using distance- and time-redshift probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern cosmology, the discovery of the Universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ SH0ES Type Ia Supernovae and BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as recently included Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma Ray Bursts data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee model and compare it with the standard LCDM cosmology. Our results indicate that the bumblebee theory provides a compatible fit with current observational data across a range of its parameters, suggesting it as a viable alternative to the LCDM model.</description>

      <title>A tale of Bethe logarithms: leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}$ and Lamb shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare annihilation decays of $P$-wave spin-triplet quarkonia into lepton pair have to proceed via two-photon intermediate state, which are plagued with the infrared divergence symptom. We recognize that the physical root of the IR divergence and its remedy is the same as the Lamb shift in QED. In this work we provide a complete solution to this IR problem by including the effect of the higher Fock component of the $\chi_{cJ}$ state, {\it viz.}, the $c\bar{c}(^3S_1^{(1)})$ pair accompanied with a very long wavelength photon. Adding the contributions from the leading and next-to-leading order Fock components together, we arrive at the IR finite and factorization scale independent predictions for leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$. The Bethe logarithms associated with these exclusive reactions are found to have rather different traits from those associated with Lamb shift. We present numerical predictions by employing several influential quark potential models. The predicted leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$ are sizable and the observation prospect for $e^+e^-\to \chi_{cJ}(1P,2P)$ at BESIII looks bright. The future observation of $e^+e^-\to X(3872)$ will shed important light on the $c\bar{c}$ content of the $X(3872)$ meson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a simplicial set originated in algebraic topology, and has also been utilized extensively in category theory, but until relatively recently was not used outside of those fields. However, with the increasing prominence of higher categorical methods in a wide range of applications, it is important for researchers in a range of fields to have a good working knowledge of them. This paper is intended as an introduction to simplicial sets, both as an overview of their development from other concepts, and as a user's guide for someone wanting to read modern literature that makes use of them.</description>

      <title>DexDiffuser: Interaction-aware Diffusion Planning for Adaptive Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves 70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>Lower tails for triangles inside the critical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability that the random graph $G(n,p)$ is triangle-free. When $p =o(n^{-1/2})$ or $p = \omega(n^{-1/2})$ the asymptotics of the logarithm of this probability are known via Janson's inequality in the former case and via regularity or hypergraph container methods in the latter case. We prove for the first time an asymptotic formula for the logarithm of this probability when $p = c n^{-1/2}$ for $c$ a sufficiently small constant.
  More generally, we study lower-tail large deviations for triangles in random graphs: the probability that $G(n,p)$ has at most $\eta$ times its expected number of triangles, when $p = c n^{-1/2}$ for $c$ and $\eta \in [0,1)$ constant. Our results apply for all $c$ if $\eta \ge .4993$ and for $c$ small enough otherwise.
  For $\eta$ small (including the case of triangle-freeness), we prove that a phase transition occurs as $c$ varies, in the sense of a non-analyticity of the rate function, while for $\eta \ge .4993$ we prove that no phase transition occurs.
  On the other hand for the random graph $G(n,m)$, with $m = b n^{3/2}$, we show that a phase transition occurs in the lower-tail problem for triangles as $b$ varies for \emph{every} $\eta \in [0,1)$.
  Our method involves ingredients from algorithms and statistical physics including the cluster expansion and concentration inequalities for contractive Markov chains.</description>

      <title>A Pipeline of Neural-Symbolic Integration to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks. However, LLMs often struggle with spatial reasoning which is one essential part of reasoning and inference and requires understanding complex relationships between objects in space. This paper proposes a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) ASP (Answer Set Programming)-based symbolic reasoning, (2) LLM + ASP pipeline using DSPy, and (3) Fact + Logical rules. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline prompting methods, with accuracy increases of 40-50% on StepGame} dataset and 3-13% on the more complex SparQA dataset. The "LLM + ASP" pipeline achieves particularly strong results on the tasks of Finding Relations (FR) and Finding Block (FB) questions, though performance varies across different question types. The impressive results suggest that while neural-symbolic approaches offer promising directions for enhancing spatial reasoning in LLMs, their effectiveness depends heavily on the specific task characteristics and implementation strategies. We propose an integrated, simple yet effective set of strategies using a neural-symbolic pipeline to boost spatial reasoning abilities in LLMs. This pipeline and its strategies demonstrate strong and broader applicability to other reasoning domains in LLMs, such as temporal reasoning, deductive inference etc.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach to learning solutions of a class of elliptic variational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a weak adversarial approach to solving obstacle problems using neural networks. By employing (generalised) regularised gap functions and their properties we rewrite the obstacle problem (which is an elliptic variational inequality) as a minmax problem, providing a natural formulation amenable to learning. Our approach, in contrast to much of the literature, does not require the elliptic operator to be symmetric. We provide an error analysis for suitable discretisations of the continuous problem, estimating in particular the approximation and statistical errors. Parametrising the solution and test function as neural networks, we apply a modified gradient descent ascent algorithm to treat the problem and conclude the paper with various examples and experiments. Our solution algorithm is in particular able to easily handle obstacle problems that feature biactivity (or lack of strict complementarity), a situation that poses difficulty for traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded, Refined, and Overhauled Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.</description>

      <title>The First Spin-Orbit Obliquity of an M dwarf/brown dwarf System: An eccentric and aligned TOI-2119 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.2^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.</description>

      <title>Building Confidence in Deep Generative Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models show promise for de novo protein design, but their effectiveness within specific protein families remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate two 3D rigid-body generative methods, score matching and flow matching, to generate monomeric protein backbones in SE(3) space. Our goal is to provide new insights and build confidence in the broader applicability of deep generative models for protein design. The optimal amino acid sequences were predicted from the generated backbones, followed by side-chain homology modeling. Results demonstrated high structural integrity, with conserved key residues aligning with known proteins. Structural phylogenetic analysis shows evolutionary links between the generated samples and their protein family members. Further molecular dynamics simulations and protein-ligand docking confirm the dynamic stability and functional potential of these samples, with ligand binding inducing conformational changes consistent with those in wild-type proteins.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Defense Against the Winner's Curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across science and policy, decision-makers often need to draw conclusions about the best candidate among competing alternatives. For instance, researchers may seek to infer the effectiveness of the most successful treatment or determine which demographic group benefits most from a specific treatment. Similarly, in machine learning, practitioners are often interested in the population performance of the model that performs best empirically. However, cherry-picking the best candidate leads to the winner's curse: the observed performance for the winner is biased upwards, rendering conclusions based on standard measures of uncertainty invalid. We introduce the zoom correction, a novel approach for valid inference on the winner. Our method is flexible: it can be employed in both parametric and nonparametric settings, can handle arbitrary dependencies between candidates, and automatically adapts to the level of selection bias. The method easily extends to important related problems, such as inference on the top k winners, inference on the value and identity of the population winner, and inference on "near-winners."</description>

      <title>Frequency redistribution and step-size distribution of light scattered by atomic vapor: applications to L\'evy flight random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of light that undergoes multiple-scattering by resonant atomic vapor can be described as a L\'evy flight. L\'evy flight is a random walk with heavy tailed step-size (r) distribution, decaying asymptotically as $P(r)\sim r^{-1-\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;2$. The large steps, typical of L\'evy flights, have its origins in frequency redistribution of the light scattered by the vapor. We calculate the frequency redistribution function and the step-size distribution for light diffusion in atomic vapor. From the step-size distribution we extract a L\'evy parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the step's size. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size distribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level structure typical for alkali vapors. Finite size of the vapor introduces cutoff on the light scattered spectrum and thus in the size of steps. Multi-level structure introduces oscillations in $P(r)$ slope. Both effects might have an impact on measurables related to the L\'evy flight random walk.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages using LoRA PEFT Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, yet challenges persist in adapting these models for low-resource languages. In this study, we investigate the effects of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on multilingual Gemma models for Marathi, a language with limited resources. Using a translated Alpaca dataset with 52,000 instruction-response pairs, our findings reveal that while evaluation metrics often show a performance decline post-fine-tuning, manual assessments frequently suggest that the fine-tuned models outperform their original counterparts. The observations indicate improvements in target language generation capabilities but a reduction in reasoning abilities following language adaptation. These results underscore the need for improved evaluation methodologies and the creation of high-quality native datasets to accurately assess language-specific model performance in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Depth Information for Detecting Manipulated Face Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face manipulation detection has been receiving a lot of attention for the reliability and security of the face images/videos. Recent studies focus on using auxiliary information or prior knowledge to capture robust manipulation traces, which are shown to be promising. As one of the important face features, the face depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as face recognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in literature for face manipulation detection. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating the face depth map as auxiliary information for robust face manipulation detection. To this end, we first propose a Face Depth Map Transformer (FDMT) to estimate the face depth map patch by patch from an RGB face image, which is able to capture the local depth anomaly created due to manipulation. The estimated face depth map is then considered as auxiliary information to be integrated with the backbone features using a Multi-head Depth Attention (MDA) mechanism that is newly designed. We also propose an RGB-Depth Inconsistency Attention (RDIA) module to effectively capture the inter-frame inconsistency for multi-frame input. Various experiments demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method for face manipulation detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit the first analogue model of a rotating black hole constructed in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. The background electromagnetic field is assumed to be algebraically special and adapted to a geodesic shear-free congruence of null rays in Minkowski spacetime, the Kerr congruence. The corresponding optical metric has a Kerr-Schild form and, it is shown to be characterized by three parameters, thus predicting the existence of an ergosurface, a horizon, and a slice identical to one also present in the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fast Krasnosel'ki\u{\i}-Mann Method with Preconditioners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study accelerated Krasnosel'ki\u{\i}-Mann-type methods with preconditioners in both continuous and discrete time. From a continuous time model, we derive a generalized fast Krasnosel'ki\u{\i}-Mann method, providing a new yet simple proof of convergence that allows for unprecedented flexibility in parameter tuning. Our analysis unifies inertial and anchoring acceleration mechanisms and offers a broad range of parameter choices, which prove beneficial in practice. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the case where preconditioners are allowed to be degenerate, unifying the treatment of various splitting methods and establishing the weak convergence of shadow sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our society is increasing, which brings with it the need to understand the behaviour of AI mechanisms, including machine learning predictive algorithms fed with tabular data, text, or images, among other types of data. This work focuses on interpretability of predictive models based on functional data. Designing interpretability methods for functional data models implies working with a set of features whose size is infinite. In the context of scalar on function regression, we propose an interpretability method based on the Shapley value for continuous games, a mathematical formulation that allows to fairly distribute a global payoff among a continuous set players. The method is illustrated through a set of experiments with simulated and real data sets. The open source Python package ShapleyFDA is also presented.</description>

      <title>The joint distribution of first return times and of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1D random walk before returning to the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>On Importance of Code-Mixed Embeddings for Hate Speech Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-mixing is the practice of using two or more languages in a single sentence, which often occurs in multilingual communities such as India where people commonly speak multiple languages. Classic NLP tools, trained on monolingual data, face challenges when dealing with code-mixed data. Extracting meaningful information from sentences containing multiple languages becomes difficult, particularly in tasks like hate speech detection, due to linguistic variation, cultural nuances, and data sparsity. To address this, we aim to analyze the significance of code-mixed embeddings and evaluate the performance of BERT and HingBERT models (trained on a Hindi-English corpus) in hate speech detection. Our study demonstrates that HingBERT models, benefiting from training on the extensive Hindi-English dataset L3Cube-HingCorpus, outperform BERT models when tested on hate speech text datasets. We also found that code-mixed Hing-FastText performs better than standard English FastText and vanilla BERT models.</description>

      <title>Pruning Deep Convolutional Neural Network Using Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high performance in image classification tasks but are challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware due to their large model sizes. To address this issue, we leverage Mutual Information, a metric that provides valuable insights into how deep learning models retain and process information through measuring the shared information between input features or output labels and network layers. In this study, we propose a structured filter-pruning approach for CNNs that identifies and selectively retains the most informative features in each layer. Our approach successively evaluates each layer by ranking the importance of its feature maps based on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) values, computed using a matrix-based Renyi {\alpha}-order entropy numerical method. We propose several formulations of CMI to capture correlation among features across different layers. We then develop various strategies to determine the cutoff point for CMI values to prune unimportant features. This approach allows parallel pruning in both forward and backward directions and significantly reduces model size while preserving accuracy. Tested on the VGG16 architecture with the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of filters by more than a third, with only a 0.32% drop in test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Surveying the space of descriptions of a composite system with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate information theory provides a general and principled framework for understanding how the components of a complex system are connected. Existing analyses are coarse in nature -- built up from characterizations of discrete subsystems -- and can be computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose to study the continuous space of possible descriptions of a composite system as a window into its organizational structure. A description consists of specific information conveyed about each of the components, and the space of possible descriptions is equivalent to the space of lossy compression schemes of the components. We introduce a machine learning framework to optimize descriptions that extremize key information theoretic quantities used to characterize organization, such as total correlation and O-information. Through case studies on spin systems, Sudoku boards, and letter sequences from natural language, we identify extremal descriptions that reveal how system-wide variation emerges from individual components. By integrating machine learning into a fine-grained information theoretic analysis of composite random variables, our framework opens a new avenues for probing the structure of real-world complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the extension of homologically trivial symplectic or Hamiltonian cyclic actions to Hamiltonian circle actions on irrational ruled symplectic $4$-manifolds. On one hand, we construct symplectic involutions on minimal irrational ruled $4$-manifolds that cannot extend to a symplectic circle action even with a possibly different symplectic form. Higher dimensional examples are also constructed. On the other hand, for homologically trivial symplectic cyclic actions of any other order, we show that such an extension always exists.
  We also classify finite groups of symplecticmorphisms that acts trivially on the first homology group, and prove the non-extendability of the Klein $4$-group action to the three dimensional rotation group action motivated by the classification of finite groups of symplectomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Parallel Token Swapping for Qubit Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a combinatorial reconfiguration problem that involves finding an optimal sequence of swaps to move an initial configuration of tokens that are placed on the vertices of a graph to a final desired one. This problem arises as a crucial step in reducing the depth of a quantum circuit when compiling a quantum algorithm. We provide the first known constant factor approximation algorithms for the parallel token swapping problem on graph topologies that are commonly found in modern quantum computers, including cycle graphs, subdivided star graphs, and grid graphs. We also study the so-called stretch factor of a natural lower bound to the problem, which has been shown to be useful when designing heuristics for the qubit routing problem. Finally, we study the colored version of this reconfiguration problem where some tokens share the same color and are considered indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Preserving SOC for enhancement of spin-to-charge conversion efficiency via Cu intercalation in MoS$_2$/CoFeB heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a novel type of quantum materials that could be used in spintronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics and opto-valleytronics. The phenomena of spinto-charge conversion at the interface between sputtered magnetic materials and transition metal dichalcogenides have gained attention for designing fast and ultra-low power consumption devices that are applicable for spintronic-based applications. Here, we report a remarkable enhancement of spin-to-charge conversion efficiency in MoS$_2$/CoFeB heterostructures via Cu intercalation. In this context, magneto-optic Kerr effect-based microscopy reveals the absence of substantial domain modification due to Cu which indicates that Cu successfully detaches MoS2 from CoFeB. This shows that Cu interlayer is protecting the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of MoS$_2$ from exchange interaction with CoFeB, since the proximity with local magnetization can alter the electronic structure and hence the SOC. Further, via first-principles calculations, it is found that notable improvements in spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity occur via the Cu intercalation which in turn increases the spin Hall angle. We have shown here that one can modify interfaces of ferromagnet and transition metal dichalcogenides-based heterostructures to achieve higher efficiencies of spin-tocharge conversion across them for extended functionalities and its relevance in spin orbit torquebased applications.</description>

      <title>Automated Literature Review Using NLP Techniques and LLM-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents and compares multiple approaches to automate the generation of literature reviews using several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM). The ever-increasing number of research articles provides a huge challenge for manual literature review. It has resulted in an increased demand for automation. Developing a system capable of automatically generating the literature reviews from only the PDF files as input is the primary objective of this research work. The effectiveness of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies, such as the frequency-based method (spaCy), the transformer model (Simple T5), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language Model (GPT-3.5-turbo), is evaluated to meet the primary objective. The SciTLDR dataset is chosen for this research experiment and three distinct techniques are utilized to implement three different systems for auto-generating the literature reviews. The ROUGE scores are used for the evaluation of all three systems. Based on the evaluation, the Large Language Model GPT-3.5-turbo achieved the highest ROUGE-1 score, 0.364. The transformer model comes in second place and spaCy is at the last position. Finally, a graphical user interface is created for the best system based on the large language model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Demazure product, also called the 0-Hecke product, is an associative operation on Coxeter groups with interesting properties and applications. In (Li et al 2024) it was shown that the Demazure product of two permutations can be described purely combinatorially: using only their one-line notation and not relying on reduced words. In this paper, we extend this to type D Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Overview of the Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for Magnetic Resonance Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiation therapy (RT) is enhancing head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment through superior soft tissue contrast and longitudinal imaging capabilities. However, manual tumor segmentation remains a significant challenge, spurring interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation. To accelerate innovation in this field, we present the Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge, a satellite event of the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention. This challenge addresses the scarcity of large, publicly available AI-ready adaptive RT datasets in HNC and explores the potential of incorporating multi-timepoint data to enhance RT auto-segmentation performance. Participants tackled two HNC segmentation tasks: automatic delineation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and gross metastatic regional lymph nodes (GTVn) on pre-RT (Task 1) and mid-RT (Task 2) T2-weighted scans. The challenge provided 150 HNC cases for training and 50 for testing, hosted on grand-challenge.org using a Docker submission framework. In total, 19 independent teams from across the world qualified by submitting both their algorithms and corresponding papers, resulting in 18 submissions for Task 1 and 15 submissions for Task 2. Evaluation using the mean aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient showed top-performing AI methods achieved scores of 0.825 in Task 1 and 0.733 in Task 2. These results surpassed clinician interobserver variability benchmarks, marking significant strides in automated tumor segmentation for MR-guided radiation therapy applications in head and neck cancer.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Gastric Digestion in the Stomach: Insights from Multiphase Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Analysis of Brain Responses in Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction: Modulating Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User engagement, cognitive participation, and motivation during task execution in physical human-robot interaction are crucial for motor learning. These factors are especially important in contexts like robotic rehabilitation, where neuroplasticity is targeted. However, traditional robotic rehabilitation systems often face challenges in maintaining user engagement, leading to unpredictable therapeutic outcomes. To address this issue, various techniques, such as assist-as-needed controllers, have been developed to prevent user slacking and encourage active participation. In this paper, we introduce a new direction through a novel multi-modal robotic interaction designed to enhance user engagement by synergistically integrating visual, motor, cognitive, and auditory (speech recognition) tasks into a single, comprehensive activity. To assess engagement quantitatively, we compared multiple electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers between this multi-modal protocol and a traditional motor-only protocol. Fifteen healthy adult participants completed 100 trials of each task type. Our findings revealed that EEG biomarkers, particularly relative alpha power, showed statistically significant improvements in engagement during the multi-modal task compared to the motor-only task. Moreover, while engagement decreased over time in the motor-only task, the multi-modal protocol maintained consistent engagement, suggesting that users could remain engaged for longer therapy sessions. Our observations on neural responses during interaction indicate that the proposed multi-modal approach can effectively enhance user engagement, which is critical for improving outcomes. This is the first time that objective neural response highlights the benefit of a comprehensive robotic intervention combining motor, cognitive, and auditory functions in healthy subjects.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Information Flow for Generalized Efficient Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While vision transformers show promise in numerous image restoration (IR) tasks, the challenge remains in efficiently generalizing and scaling up a model for multiple IR tasks. To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Bit symmetry entails the symmetry of the quantum transition probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is quite common to use the generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) as generic models to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles and to gain a better understanding of the probabilistic or information theoretic foundations of quantum physics and quantum computing. A variety of symmetry postulates was introduced and studied in this framework, including the transitivity of the automorphism group (1) on the pure states, (2) on the pairs of orthogonal pure states [these pairs are called 2-frames] and (3) on any frames of the same size. The second postulate is M\"uller and Ududec's bit symmetry, which they motivate by quantum computational needs. Here we explore these three postulates in the transition probability framework, which is more specific than the GPTs since the existence of the transition probabilities for the quantum logical atoms is presupposed either directly or indirectly via a certain geometric property of the state space. This property for compact convex sets was introduced by the author in a recent paper. We show that bit symmetry implicates the symmetry of the transition probabilities between the atoms. Using a result by Barnum and Hilgert, we can then conclude that the third rather strong symmetry postulate rules out all models but the classical cases and in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Recoverable Robust Optimization in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recoverable robust optimization is a popular multi-stage approach, in which it is possible to adjust a first-stage solution after the uncertain cost scenario is revealed. We consider recoverable robust optimization in combination with discrete budgeted uncertainty. In this setting, it seems plausible that many problems become $\Sigma^p_3$-complete and therefore it is impossible to find compact IP formulations of them (unless the unlikely conjecture NP $= \Sigma^p_3$ holds). Even though this seems plausible, few concrete results of this kind are known. In this paper, we fill that gap of knowledge. We consider recoverable robust optimization for the nominal problems of Sat, 3Sat, vertex cover, dominating set, set cover, hitting set, feedback vertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location, $p$-center, $p$-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack, partition, scheduling, Hamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, $k$-disjoint path ($k \geq 2$), and Steiner tree. We show that for each of these problems, and for each of three widely used distance measures, the recoverable robust problem becomes $\Sigma^p_3$-complete. Concretely, we show that all these problems share a certain abstract property and prove that this property implies that their robust recoverable counterpart is $\Sigma^p_3$-complete. This reveals the insight that all the above problems are $\Sigma^p_3$-complete 'for the same reason'. Our result extends a recent framework by Gr\"une and Wulf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TorchOptics is an open-source Python library for differentiable Fourier optics simulations, developed using PyTorch to enable GPU-accelerated tensor computations and automatic differentiation. It provides a comprehensive framework for modeling, analyzing, and designing optical systems using Fourier optics, with applications in imaging, diffraction, holography, and signal processing. The library leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine for gradient-based optimization, enabling the inverse design of complex optical systems. TorchOptics supports end-to-end optimization of hybrid models that integrate optical systems with machine learning architectures for digital post-processing. The library includes a wide range of optical elements and spatial profiles, and supports simulations with polarized light and fields with arbitrary spatial coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan anomaly using holography, finding that the $U(1)$ axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We also compute the thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term, revealing its characteristic $T^2$ dependence.</description>

      <title>CkIO: Parallel File Input for Over-Decomposed Task-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel input performance issues are often neglected in large scale parallel applications in Computational Science and Engineering. Traditionally, there has been less focus on input performance because either input sizes are small (as in biomolecular simulations) or the time doing input is insignificant compared with the simulation with many timesteps. But newer applications, such as graph algorithms add a premium to file input performance. Additionally, over-decomposed systems, such as Charm++/AMPI, present new challenges in this context in comparison to MPI applications. In the over-decomposition model, naive parallel I/O in which every task makes its own I/O request is impractical. Furthermore, load balancing supported by models such as Charm++/AMPI precludes assumption of data contiguity on individual nodes. We develop a new I/O abstraction to address these issues by separating the decomposition of consumers of input data from that of file-reader tasks that interact with the file system. This enables applications to scale the number of consumers of data without impacting I/O behavior or performance. These ideas are implemented in a new input library, CkIO, that is built on Charm++, which is a well-known task-based and overdecomposed-partitions system. CkIO is configurable via multiple parameters (such as the number of file readers and/or their placement) that can be tuned depending on characteristics of the application, such as file size and number of application objects. Additionally, CkIO input allows for capabilities such as effective overlap of input and application-level computation, as well as load balancing and migration. We describe the relevant challenges in understanding file system behavior and architecture, the design alternatives being explored, and preliminary performance data.</description>

      <title>Biomolecular Analysis of Soil Samples and Rock Imagery for Tracing Evidence of Life Using a Mobile Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for evidence of past life on Mars presents a tremendous challenge that requires the usage of very advanced robotic technologies to overcome it. Current digital microscopic imagers and spectrometers used for astrobiological examination suffer from limitations such as insufficient resolution, narrow detection range, and lack of portability. To overcome these challenges, this research study presents modifications to the Phoenix rover to expand its capability for detecting biosignatures on Mars. This paper examines the modifications implemented on the Phoenix rover to enhance its capability to detect a broader spectrum of biosignatures. One of the notable improvements comprises the integration of advanced digital microscopic imagers and spectrometers, enabling high-resolution examination of soil samples. Additionally, the mechanical components of the device have been reinforced to enhance maneuverability and optimize subsurface sampling capabilities. Empirical investigations have demonstrated that Phoenix has the capability to navigate diverse geological environments and procure samples for the purpose of biomolecular analysis. The biomolecular instrumentation and hybrid analytical methods showcased in this study demonstrate considerable potential for future astrobiology missions on Mars.

      <title>Potential technosignature from anomalously low deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) in planetary water depleted by nuclear fusion technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion is viewed as an ideal energy source for humanity in the far future, given a vast seawater supply of D. Here, we consider long-lived, extraterrestrial, technological societies that develop DD fusion. If such a society persists over geologic timescales, oceanic deuterium would diminish. For an ocean mass and initial D/H that are Earth-like, fusion power use of only $\sim$10 times that projected for humankind next century would deplete the deuterium-hydrogen ratio (D/H) in $\sim$(a few)$\times 10^8$ years to values below that of the local Interstellar Medium (ISM). Ocean masses of a few percent Earth's would reach anomalously low D/H in $\sim10^6$ to $10^7$ years. The timescale shortens with greater energy consumption, smaller oceans, or lower initial D/H. Here, we suggest that anomalous D/H in planetary water below local ISM values of $\sim16\times 10^{-6}$ (set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis plus deuterium loss onto dust or small admixtures of deuterium-poor stellar material) may be a technosignature. Unlike SETI from radio signals, anomalous D/H would persist for eons, even if civilizations perish or relocate. We discuss wavelengths of strong absorption features for detecting D/H anomalies in atmospheric water vapor. These are vibrational O-D stretching at 3.7 $\mu$m in transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like worlds, $\sim1.5$ $\mu$m (in the wings of the 1.4 $\mu$m water band) in the shorter near-infrared for direct imaging by Habitable Worlds Observatory, and 3.7 $\mu$m or $\sim7.5$ $\mu$m (in the wings of the broad 6.3 $\mu$m bending vibration of water) for concepts like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE).</description>

      <title>On the thresholds of degenerate hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate if $m_1(G)\le{d}$ and there exists a constant $\varepsilon &gt;0$ such that for every subset $U\subseteq{V(G)}$ with size $2\le|U|\le{\varepsilon n}$, we have $e\left(G[U]\right)\le{d\left(|U|-1\right)-\alpha}$. These hypergraphs include many natural graph classes, such as the degenerate hypergraphs, the planar graphs, and the power of cycles. In this paper, we consider the threshold of the emergence of a $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate hypergraph with bounded maximum degree in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We show that its threshold is at most $n^{-1/d}$, improving previous results of Riordan and Kelly-M\"uyesser-Pokrovskiy.</description>

      <title>Structured light with a million light planes per second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a structured light system that captures full-frame depth at rates of a thousand frames per second, four times faster than the previous state of the art. Our key innovation to this end is the design of an acousto-optic light scanning device that can scan light planes at rates up to two million planes per second. We combine this device with an event camera for structured light, using the sparse events triggered on the camera as we sweep a light plane on the scene for depth triangulation. In contrast to prior work, where light scanning is the bottleneck towards faster structured light operation, our light scanning device is three orders of magnitude faster than the event camera's full-frame bandwidth, thus allowing us to take full advantage of the event camera's fast operation. To surpass this bandwidth, we additionally demonstrate adaptive scanning of only regions of interest, at speeds an order of magnitude faster than the theoretical full-frame limit for event cameras.</description>

      <title>Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning: Unifying Beyond-Communication Capabilities with MDMA in 6G and Future Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution and convergence of wireless technologies and vertical applications have fundamentally reshaped our lifestyles and industries. Future wireless networks, especially 6G, are poised to support a wide range of applications enabled by heterogeneous services, leveraging both traditional connectivity-centric functions and emerging beyond-communication capabilities, particularly localization, sensing, and synchronization. However, integrating these new capabilities into a unified 6G paradigm presents significant challenges. This article provides an in-depth analysis of these technical challenges for integrative 6G design and proposes three strategies for concurrent heterogeneous service provisioning, with the aggregated goal of maximizing integration gains while minimizing service provisioning overhead. First, we adopt multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) as an inclusive enabling platform to flexibly integrate various capabilities by shared access to multi-dimensional radio resources. Next, we propose value-oriented heterogeneous service provisioning to maximize the integration gain through situation-aware MDMA. To enhance scalability, we optimize control and user planes by eliminating redundant control information and enabling service-oriented prioritization. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework with a case study on integrated synchronization and communication, demonstrating its potential for concurrent heterogeneous service provisioning.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested advective accretion flows and jets/outflows around stellar mass black holes: Explaining hard state ULXs with GRMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optically thin advective accretion disk is crucial for explaining the hard state of black hole sources. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we investigate how a large-scale, strong magnetic field influences accretion and outflows/jets, depending on the field geometry, magnetic field strength, and the spin parameter of the black hole. We simulate a sub-Eddington, advective disk-outflow system in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which likely remains in the hard state. The model simulations based on HARMPI successfully explain ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the hard state, typically observed with luminosities ranging from $10^{39}$ - $10^{40}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our simulations generally describe the bright, hard state of stellar-mass black hole sources without requiring a super-Eddington accretion rate. This work explores the characteristics of ULXs without invoking intermediate-mass black holes. The observed high luminosity is attributed to the energy stored in the strong magnetic fields, which can generate super-Eddington luminosity. The combined energy of the matter and magnetic field leads to such significant luminosity.</description>

      <title>On the Fractional Dynamics of Kinks in sine-Gordon Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the dynamics of single kinks, kink-anti-kink pairs and bound states in the prototypical fractional Klein-Gordon example of the sine-Gordon equation. In particular, we modify the order $\beta$ of the temporal derivative to that of a Caputo fractional type and find that, for $1&lt;\beta&lt;2$, this imposes a dissipative dynamical behavior on the coherent structures. We also examine the variation of a fractional Riesz order $\alpha$ on the spatial derivative. Here, depending on whether this order is below or above the harmonic value $\alpha = 2$, we find, respectively, monotonically attracting kinks, or non-monotonic and potentially attracting or repelling kinks, with a saddle equilibrium separating the two. Finally, we also explore the interplay of the two derivatives, when both Caputo temporal and Riesz spatial derivatives are involved.</description>

      <title>Gravitational atoms beyond the test field limit: The case of Sgr A* and ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation. We resolve the region near the horizon as well as the far field region. Our results are relevant in a wide range of masses, from ultralight to MeV scalar fields and for black holes ranging from primordial to supermassive. For instance, a system with a scalar field consistent with ultralight dark matter and a black hole mass comparable to that of Sagittarius A* can be modeled. A density spike near the event horizon, although present, is negligible, contrasting with the prediction in [P. Gondolo and Silk, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1719-1722, 1999] for cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving the Effectiveness of Synthetic Chest X-Rays for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To explore best-practice approaches for generating synthetic chest X-ray images and augmenting medical imaging datasets to optimize the performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation, reheating and leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor problem, inflation, post-inflationary reheating, and baryogenesis. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We find that the same couplings responsible for reheating also contribute to generating part of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameters of the convexity spaces associated with families of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where every intersection between $t$ sets of the family has its Betti numbers bounded from above by a function of $t$. Although the Radon number of such families may not be bounded, we show that these families satisfy a fractional Helly theorem. To achieve this, we introduce graded analogues of the Radon and Helly numbers. This generalizes previously known fractional Helly theorems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scale Variations: Perturbative Theory Uncertainties from Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to estimate the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in perturbative predictions (the perturbative "theory uncertainty"), which overcomes many inherent limitations of the currently prevalent methods based on varying unphysical renormalization scales. In our approach, the true underlying sources of the theory uncertainty, namely the missing higher-order terms, are identified and parameterized in terms of mutually independent theory nuisance parameters (TNPs). The TNPs are true parameters of the calculation, i.e., they have a well-defined true value that is not or only imprecisely known. This approach affords the theory uncertainty all benefits of a truly parametric uncertainty: It provides correct correlations and allows for consistent error propagation and combination. Furthermore, the TNPs can be profiled in fits, allowing the data to reduce the theory uncertainties. On the theory side, it allows maximally exploiting all available higher-order information to reduce the theory uncertainty, such as partial higher-order results or any nontrivial knowledge of the higher-order or all-order structure. We first discuss the method in general as it can be applied across the board of perturbative calculations. As a concrete application, we then discuss the resummed transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum in Drell-Yan production, and how TNP-based uncertainties can correctly capture the correlations across the $q_T$ spectrum and between $Z$ and $W$ production. This application is the basis of the theory model enabling the recent precise measurement of the $W$-boson mass by the CMS experiment. In a forthcoming paper, we use it to study the theory uncertainties in extracting the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>Task Arithmetic Through The Lens Of One-Shot Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task Arithmetic is a model merging technique that enables the combination of multiple models' capabilities into a single model through simple arithmetic in the weight space, without the need for additional fine-tuning or access to the original training data. However, the factors that determine the success of Task Arithmetic remain unclear. In this paper, we examine Task Arithmetic for multi-task learning by framing it as a one-shot Federated Learning problem. We demonstrate that Task Arithmetic is mathematically equivalent to the commonly used algorithm in Federated Learning, called Federated Averaging (FedAvg). By leveraging well-established theoretical results from FedAvg, we identify two key factors that impact the performance of Task Arithmetic: data heterogeneity and training heterogeneity. To mitigate these challenges, we adapt several algorithms from Federated Learning to improve the effectiveness of Task Arithmetic. Our experiments demonstrate that applying these algorithms can often significantly boost performance of the merged model compared to the original Task Arithmetic approach. This work bridges Task Arithmetic and Federated Learning, offering new theoretical perspectives on Task Arithmetic and improved practical methodologies for model merging.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependence of spin-phonon relaxation and dephasing due to g-factor fluctuations from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxation of electrons in materials involve both reversible dephasing and irreversible decoherence processes. Their interplay leads to a complex dependence of spin relaxation times on the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, relevant for spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we use real-time first-principles density matrix dynamics simulations to directly simulate Hahn echo measurements, disentangle dephasing from decoherence, and predict T1, T2 and T2* spin lifetimes. We show that g-factor fluctuations lead to non-trivial magnetic field dependence of each of these lifetimes in inversion-symmetric crystals of CsPbBr3 and silicon, even when only intrinsic spin-phonon scattering is present. Most importantly, fluctuations in the off-diagonal components of the g-tensor lead to a strong magnetic field dependence of even the T1 lifetime in silicon. Our calculations elucidate the detailed role of anisotropic g-factors in determining the spin dynamics even in simple, low spin-orbit coupling materials such as silicon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot sub-luminous stars represent a population of stripped and evolved red giants located at the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB). Since they exhibit a wide range of variability due to pulsations or binary interactions, unveiling their intrinsic and extrinsic variability is crucial for understanding the physical processes responsible for their formation. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they overlap with interacting binaries such as Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). By leveraging cutting-edge clustering algorithm tools, we investigate the variability of 1,576 hot subdwarf variable candidates using comprehensive data from Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations. We present a novel approach that utilises the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction algorithms to facilitate the identification and classification of different populations of variable hot subdwarfs and Cataclysmic Variables in a large dataset. In addition to the Gaia time-series statistics table, we adopt extra statistical features that enhance the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results lead to the identification of 85 new hot subdwarf variables based on Gaia and TESS lightcurves and 108 new variables based on Gaia lightcurves alone, including reflection-effect systems, HW Vir, ellipsoidal variables, and high-amplitude pulsating variables. A significant number of known Cataclysmic Variables (140) distinctively cluster in the 2-D feature space among an additional 152 objects that we consider new Cataclysmic Variable candidates. This study paves the way for more efficient and comprehensive analyses of stellar variability from both ground and space-based observations, as well as the application of machine learning classifications of variable candidates in large surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system is a kinetic model for collisionless plasmas. For the two-dimensional model, global well-posedness of this model is known and was proven by deriving global bounds on the momentum support of the particle density function. In this paper, we prove bounds on the magnitude of the momentum support in one direction depending on the magnitude of the support in the corresponding orthogonal direction.</description>

      <title>Novel Class Discovery for Open Set Raga Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of Raga classification in Indian Art Music (IAM) is constrained by the limited availability of labeled datasets, resulting in many Ragas being unrepresented during the training of machine learning models. Traditional Raga classification methods rely on supervised learning, and assume that for a test audio to be classified by a Raga classification model, it must have been represented in the training data, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where novel, unseen Ragas may appear. To address this limitation, we propose a method based on Novel Class Discovery (NCD) to detect and classify previously unseen Ragas. Our approach utilizes a feature extractor trained in a supervised manner to generate embeddings, which are then employed within a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised training, enabling the identification of previously unseen Raga classes. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately detect audio samples corresponding to these novel Ragas, offering a robust solution for utilizing the vast amount of unlabeled music data available online. This approach reduces the need for manual labeling while expanding the repertoire of recognized Ragas, and other music data in Music Information Retrieval (MIR).</description>

      <title>Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Linearly Structured $f$-Divergence Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (DRMDP) is a popular framework for addressing dynamics shift in reinforcement learning by learning policies robust to the worst-case transition dynamics within a constrained set. However, solving its dual optimization oracle poses significant challenges, limiting theoretical analysis and computational efficiency. The recently proposed Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) replaces the uncertainty set constraint with a regularization term on the value function, offering improved scalability and theoretical insights. Yet, existing RRMDP methods rely on unstructured regularization, often leading to overly conservative policies by considering transitions that are unrealistic. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear robust regularized Markov decision process ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces a linear latent structure into both transition kernels and regularization. For the offline RL setting, where an agent learns robust policies from a pre-collected dataset in the nominal environment, we develop a family of algorithms, Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI), employing linear function approximation and $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, showing these bounds depend on how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. This term is further shown to be fundamental to $d$-RRMDPs via information-theoretic lower bounds. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and is computationally more efficient than methods for constrained DRMDPs.</description>

      <title>CAT4D: Create Anything in 4D with Multi-View Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CAT4D, a method for creating 4D (dynamic 3D) scenes from monocular video. CAT4D leverages a multi-view video diffusion model trained on a diverse combination of datasets to enable novel view synthesis at any specified camera poses and timestamps. Combined with a novel sampling approach, this model can transform a single monocular video into a multi-view video, enabling robust 4D reconstruction via optimization of a deformable 3D Gaussian representation. We demonstrate competitive performance on novel view synthesis and dynamic scene reconstruction benchmarks, and highlight the creative capabilities for 4D scene generation from real or generated videos.

      <title>Optimal root recovery for uniform attachment trees and $d$-regular growing trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider root-finding algorithms for random rooted trees grown by uniform attachment. Given an unlabeled copy of the tree and a target accuracy $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, such an algorithm outputs a set of nodes that contains the root with probability at least $1 - \varepsilon$. We prove that, for the optimal algorithm, an output set of size $\exp(O(\log^{1/2}(1/\varepsilon)))$ suffices; this bound is sharp and answers a question of Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi (2017). We prove similar bounds for random regular trees that grow by uniform attachment, strengthening a result of Khim and Loh (2017).</description>

      <title>Proactive Gradient Conflict Mitigation in Multi-Task Learning: A Sparse Training Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing towards generalist agents necessitates the concurrent processing of multiple tasks using a unified model, thereby underscoring the growing significance of simultaneous model training on multiple downstream tasks. A common issue in multi-task learning is the occurrence of gradient conflict, which leads to potential competition among different tasks during joint training. This competition often results in improvements in one task at the expense of deterioration in another. Although several optimization methods have been developed to address this issue by manipulating task gradients for better task balancing, they cannot decrease the incidence of gradient conflict. In this paper, we systematically investigate the occurrence of gradient conflict across different methods and propose a strategy to reduce such conflicts through sparse training (ST), wherein only a portion of the model's parameters are updated during training while keeping the rest unchanged. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ST effectively mitigates conflicting gradients and leads to superior performance. Furthermore, ST can be easily integrated with gradient manipulation techniques, thus enhancing their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Self-Distillation for Zero-Shot Customized Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models produce impressive results but are frustrating tools for artists who desire fine-grained control. For example, a common use case is to create images of a specific instance in novel contexts, i.e., "identity-preserving generation". This setting, along with many other tasks (e.g., relighting), is a natural fit for image+text-conditional generative models. However, there is insufficient high-quality paired data to train such a model directly. We propose Diffusion Self-Distillation, a method for using a pre-trained text-to-image model to generate its own dataset for text-conditioned image-to-image tasks. We first leverage a text-to-image diffusion model's in-context generation ability to create grids of images and curate a large paired dataset with the help of a Visual-Language Model. We then fine-tune the text-to-image model into a text+image-to-image model using the curated paired dataset. We demonstrate that Diffusion Self-Distillation outperforms existing zero-shot methods and is competitive with per-instance tuning techniques on a wide range of identity-preservation generation tasks, without requiring test-time optimization.</description>

      <title>Online versus Offline Adversaries in Property Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study property testing with incomplete or noisy inputs. The models we consider allow for adversarial manipulation of the input, but differ in whether the manipulation can be done only offline, i.e., before the execution of the algorithm, or {\em online}, i.e., as the algorithm runs. The manipulations by an adversary can come in the form of erasures or corruptions. We compare the query complexity and the randomness complexity of property testing in the offline and online models. Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, and Varma (Theory Comput.`23) provide properties that can be tested with a small number of queries with offline erasures, but cannot be tested at all with online erasures. We demonstrate that the two models are incomparable in terms of query complexity: we construct properties that can be tested with a constant number of queries in the online corruption model, but require querying a significant fraction of the input in the offline erasure model. We also construct properties that exhibit a strong separation between the randomness complexity of testing in the presence of offline and online adversaries: testing these properties in the online model requires exponentially more random bits than in the offline model, even when they are tested with nearly the same number of queries in both models. Our randomness separation relies on a novel reduction from randomness-efficient testers in the adversarial online model to query-efficient testers in the standard model.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the Real Higgs Triplet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the Standard Model extended by a $Y=0$ real Higgs triplet, the $\Delta$SM. It contains a $CP$-even neutral Higgs ($\Delta^0$) and two charged Higgs bosons ($\Delta^\pm$), which are quasi-degenerate in mass. We first study the theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity and then calculate the Higgs decays, including the loop-induced modes such as di-photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and $Z\gamma$. In the limit of a small mixing between the SM Higgs and $\Delta^0$, the latter decays dominantly to $WW$ and can have a sizable branching ratio to di-photon. The model predicts a positive definite shift in the $W$ mass, which agrees with the current global electroweak fit. At the Large Hadron Collider, it leads to a $(i)$ stau-like signature from $pp\to \Delta^+\Delta^-\to \tau^+\tau^-\nu\bar\nu$, $(ii)$ multi-lepton final states from $pp\to \gamma^*\to \Delta^+\Delta^-\to W^+W^-ZZ$ and $pp\to W^{*} \to \Delta^\pm\Delta^0\to W^\pm Z W^+W^-$ as well as $(iii)$ associated di-photon production from $pp\to W^{*} \to \Delta^\pm(\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma)$. Concerning $(i)$, the reinterpretation of the recent supersymmetric tau partner search by ATLAS and CMS excludes $m_{\Delta^\pm}&lt;110$ GeV at 95% CL. From $(ii)$, some of the signal regions of multi-lepton searches lead to bounds close to the predicted cross-section, but electroweak scale masses are still allowed. For $(iii)$, the recast of the associated di-photon searches by ATLAS and a combined log-likelihood fit of signal and background to data find that out of the 25 signal regions, 10 provide relevant limits on Br$(\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma)$ at the per cent level. Interestingly, 6 signal regions show excesses at around 152 GeV, leading to a preference for a non-zero di-photon branching ratio of about 0.7% with the corresponding significance amounting to about $4\sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive semiclassical Boltzmann equations describing thermalization of an ensemble of excitons due to exciton-phonon interactions taking into account the fact that excitons are not ideal bosons but composite particles consisting of electrons and holes. We demonstrate that with a standard definition of excitonic creation and annihilation operators, one faces a problem of the total particle number nonconservation and propose its possible solution based on the introduction of operators with angular momentum algebra. We then derive a set of kinetic equations describing the evolution of the excitonic density in the reciprocal space and analyze how the composite statistics of the excitons affects the thermalization processes in the system.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semi-Supervised Learning to Enhance Data Mining for Image Classification under Limited Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 21st-century information age, with the development of big data technology, effectively extracting valuable information from massive data has become a key issue. Traditional data mining methods are inadequate when faced with large-scale, high-dimensional and complex data. Especially when labeled data is scarce, their performance is greatly limited. This study optimizes data mining algorithms by introducing semi-supervised learning methods, aiming to improve the algorithm's ability to utilize unlabeled data, thereby achieving more accurate data analysis and pattern recognition under limited labeled data conditions. Specifically, we adopt a self-training method and combine it with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and classification, and continuously improve the model prediction performance through an iterative process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. Notable improvements were observed in key performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, the robustness and noise-resistance capabilities of the semi-supervised CNN model were validated through experiments under varying noise levels, confirming its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: 3D geometric information is essential for manipulation tasks, as robots need to perceive the 3D environment, reason about spatial relationships, and interact with intricate spatial configurations. Recent research has increasingly focused on the explicit extraction of 3D features, while still facing challenges such as the lack of large-scale robotic 3D data and the potential loss of spatial geometry. To address these limitations, we propose the Lift3D framework, which progressively enhances 2D foundation models with implicit and explicit 3D robotic representations to construct a robust 3D manipulation policy. Specifically, we first design a task-aware masked autoencoder that masks task-relevant affordance patches and reconstructs depth information, enhancing the 2D foundation model's implicit 3D robotic representation. After self-supervised fine-tuning, we introduce a 2D model-lifting strategy that establishes a positional mapping between the input 3D points and the positional embeddings of the 2D model. Based on the mapping, Lift3D utilizes the 2D foundation model to directly encode point cloud data, leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge to construct explicit 3D robotic representations while minimizing spatial information loss. In experiments, Lift3D consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across several simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>GeneMAN: Generalizable Single-Image 3D Human Reconstruction from Multi-Source Human Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a single in-the-wild human photo, it remains a challenging task to reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D human model. Existing methods face difficulties including a) the varying body proportions captured by in-the-wild human images; b) diverse personal belongings within the shot; and c) ambiguities in human postures and inconsistency in human textures. In addition, the scarcity of high-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems, we propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed GeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality human data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our generated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1) Without relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a human-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion model, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction, respectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the Geometry Initialization-&amp;-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover high-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve high-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture Refinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the pixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could generate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better generalizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding high-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of the body proportions in the input images.</description>

      <title>Textured Gaussians for Enhanced 3D Scene Appearance Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor. Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity. We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: Scale and redshift variation of velocity and density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06515v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the scale and redshift variation of density and velocity distributions in self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow by a halo-based non-projection approach. All particles are divided into halo and out-of-halo particles for redshift variation of distributions. Without projecting particle fields onto a structured grid, the scale variation is analyzed by identifying all particle pairs on different scales $r$. We demonstrate that: i) Delaunay tessellation can be used to reconstruct the density field. The density correlation, spectrum, and dispersion functions were obtained, modeled, and compared with the N-body simulation; ii) the velocity distributions are symmetric on both small and large scales and are non-symmetric with a negative skewness on intermediate scales due to the inverse energy cascade at a constant rate $\varepsilon_u$; iii) On small scales, the even order moments of pairwise velocity $\Delta u_L$ follow a two-thirds law $\propto{(-\varepsilon_ur)}^{2/3}$, while the odd order moments follow a linear scaling $\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n+1}\rangle=(2n+1)\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n}\rangle\langle\Delta u_L\rangle\propto{r}$; iv) The scale variation of the velocity distributions was studied for longitudinal velocities $u_L$ or $u_L^{'}$, pairwise velocity (velocity difference) $\Delta u_L$=$u_L^{'}$-$u_L$ and velocity sum $\Sigma u_L$=$u^{'}_L$+$u_L$. Fully developed velocity fields are never Gaussian on any scale, despite that they can initially be Gaussian; v) On small scales, $u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a $X$ distribution to maximize the system entropy; vi) On large scales, $\Delta u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a logistic or a $X$ distribution; vii) the redshift variation of the velocity distributions follows the evolution of the $X$ distribution involving a shape parameter $\alpha(z)$ decreasing with time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12090v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant, two-dimensional, aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1 ms interferogram. The non-redundancy of the aperture mask in the technique enables it to be resistant to spatial phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: McReynolds showed that every compact Nil 3-manifold occurs as the cusp cross-section of some arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-manifold. We classify which commensurability classes of cusped, arithmetic, complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds admit cusps with cross-section homeomorphic to a given compact Nil 3-manifold. In particular, there are some Nil 3-manifolds which occur as cusps in every such commensurability class, and some which only occur in a single commensurability class. We also show that every compact Nil 3-manifold occurs as the cusp cross-section of some non-arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-manifold.</description>

      <title>On the evidence of dynamical dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the robustness of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in capturing the dynamical behavior of dark energy, we assess the model dependence of the evidence for dynamical dark energy inferred from the DESI BAO data. While the DESI BAO data slightly tightens the constraints on model parameters and increases the tension between the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model and the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that the influence of DESI BAO data on the constraint of $w_0$ is small in the SSLCPL model. In comparison to the CPL model, the tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model is reduced for the SSLCPL model, suggesting that the evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI BAO data is dependent on cosmological models. The inclusion of spatial curvature has little impact on the results in the SSLCPL model.</description>

      <title>When Is Heterogeneity Actionable for Personalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeting and personalization policies can be used to improve outcomes beyond the uniform policy that assigns the best performing treatment in an A/B test to everyone. Personalization relies on the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effects, yet, as we show in this paper, heterogeneity alone is not sufficient for personalization to be successful. We develop a statistical model to quantify "actionable heterogeneity," or the conditions when personalization is likely to outperform the best uniform policy. We show that actionable heterogeneity can be visualized as crossover interactions in outcomes across treatments and depends on three population-level parameters: within-treatment heterogeneity, cross-treatment correlation, and the variation in average responses. Our model can be used to predict the expected gain from personalization prior to running an experiment and also allows for sensitivity analysis, providing guidance on how changing treatments can affect the personalization gain. To validate our model, we apply five common personalization approaches to two large-scale field experiments with many interventions that encouraged flu vaccination. We find an 18% gain from personalization in one and a more modest 4% gain in the other, which is consistent with our model. Counterfactual analysis shows that this difference in the gains from personalization is driven by a drastic difference in within-treatment heterogeneity. However, reducing cross-treatment correlation holds a larger potential to further increase personalization gains. Our findings provide a framework for assessing the potential from personalization and offer practical recommendations for improving gains from targeting in multi-intervention settings.</description>

      <title>Tidal Resonance in Binary Neutron Star Inspirals: A High-Precision Study in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal resonance of the fundamental ($f$-)mode in spinning neutron stars, robustly tracing the onset of the excitation to its saturation, using numerical relativity for the first time. We performed long-term ($\approx15$~orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the $f$-mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasi-circular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The $f$-mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of $\gtrsim6.3\%$ in the linear regime and much more as $\sim33\%$ during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of $\lesssim40$~radians is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.</description>

      <title>Robust translational invariance in topological bands against lattice potentials and disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically show that the continuous magnetic translational invariance within the Hilbert (sub-)space of a single Landau level (LL) can persist even in the presence of a superlattice electrostatic potential modulation, while such invariance is broken in the full real-space Hilbert space. This is due to the interplay of the superlattice constant and the fundamental length scale of the quantum Hall fluids. In particular for the lowest LL (LLL), when the spacing of superlattice is below the magnetic length, continuous magnetic translational symmetry is very robust. For the fractional quantum Hall phases, the continuous translational symmetry is preserved when the superlattice spacing is below the corresponding fundamental lengths which we can now quantitatively define, which is different from the length scale from the quantum metric. Moreover, our analysis implies that the dynamics of the anyonic excitations can be robust against the long wavelength part of the disorder, and we discuss the related experimental ramifications.</description>

      <title>From the Shastry-Sutherland model to the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalized Shastry-Sutherland model which bridges the Shastry-Sutherland model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. By employing large scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully Augmented Matrix Product State calculations, combined with careful finite-size scaling, we find the phase transition between the plaquette valence bond state (PVBS) and Neel anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phase in the pure Shastry-Sutherland model is a weak first one. This result indicates the existence of an exotic tri-critical point in the PVBS to AFM transition line in the phase diagram, as the transition in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model was previously determined to be continuous. We determine the location of the tri-critical point in the phase diagram at which first-order transition turns to continuous. Our generalized Shastry-Sutherland model provides not only a valuable platform to explore exotic phases and phase transitions but also more realistic description of Shastry-Sutherland materials like SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description>

Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence conjecture for combinatorial designs, answering a question of Steiner from 1853. More generally, we show that the natural divisibility conditions are sufficient for clique decompositions of simplicial complexes that satisfy a certain pseudorandomness condition. As a further generalisation, we obtain the same conclusion only assuming an extendability property and the existence of a robust fractional clique decomposition.</description>

      <title>Medium effects on freeze-out of light clusters at NICA energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.07645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the chemical freeze-out of light nuclear clusters for NICA energies of above 2 A GeV. On the one hand we use results from the low energy domain of about 35 A MeV, where medium effects have been shown to be important to explain experimental results. On the high energy side of LHC energies the statistical model without medium effects has provided results for the chemical freeze-out. The two approaches extrapolated to NICA energies show a discrepancy that can be attributed to medium effects and that for the deuteron/proton ratio amounts to a factor of about three. These findings underline the importance of a detailed investigation of light cluster production at NICA energies.</description>

      <title>From interpretability to inference: an estimation framework for universal approximators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.04209v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimation and inference for the broad class of universal approximators. Estimation is based on the decomposition of model predictions into Shapley values. Inference relies on analyzing the bias and variance properties of individual Shapley components. We show that Shapley value estimation is asymptotically unbiased, and we introduce Shapley regressions as a tool to uncover the true data generating process from noisy data alone. The well-known case of the linear regression is the special case in our framework if the model is linear in parameters. We present theoretical, numerical, and empirical results for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects as our guiding example.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter Signals in Timing Spectra at Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity to dark matter signals at neutrino experiments is fundamentally challenged by the neutrino rates, as they leave similar signatures in their detectors. As a way to improve the signal sensitivity, we investigate a dark matter search strategy which utilizes the timing and energy spectra to discriminate dark matter from neutrino signals at low-energy, pulsed-beam neutrino experiments. This strategy was proposed in our companion paper arXiv:1906.10745, which we apply to potential searches at COHERENT, JSNS$^2$, and CCM. These experiments are not only sources of neutrinos but also high intensity sources of photons. The dark matter candidate of interest comes from the relatively prompt decay of a dark sector gauge boson which may replace a Standard-Model photon, so the delayed neutrino events can be suppressed by keeping prompt events only. Furthermore, prompt neutrino events can be rejected by a cut in recoil energy spectra, as their incoming energy is relatively small and bounded from above while dark matter may deposit a sizable energy beyond it. We apply the search strategy of imposing a combination of energy and timing cuts to the existing CsI data of the COHERENT experiment as a concrete example, and report a mild excess beyond known backgrounds. We then investigate the expected sensitivity reaches to dark matter signals in our benchmark experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin shuttling in a silicon double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.03598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of quantum information between different nodes of a quantum device is among the challenging functionalities of a quantum processor. In the context of spin qubits, this requirement can be met by coherent electron spin shuttling between semiconductor quantum dots. Here we theoretically study a minimal version of spin shuttling between two quantum dots. To this end, we analyze the dynamics of an electron during a detuning sweep in a silicon double quantum dot (DQD) occupied by one electron. Possibilities and limitations of spin transport are investigated. Spin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect in an inhomogeneous magnetic field play an important role for spin shuttling and are included in our model. Interactions that couple the position, spin and valley degrees of freedom open a number of avoided crossings in the spectrum allowing for diabatic transitions and interfering paths. The outcomes of single and repeated spin shuttling protocols are explored by means of numerical simulations and an approximate analytical model based on the solution of the Landau--Zener problem. We find that a spin infidelity as low as $1-F_s\lesssim 0.002$ with a relatively fast level velocity of $\alpha = 600\, {\mu}$eV/ns is feasible for optimal choices of parameters or by making use of constructive interference.</description>

Abstract: Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ be an exponential period. We show that the real and imaginary part of $\alpha$ are up to signs volumes of sets definable in the o-minimal structure generated by $\mathbb{Q}$, the real exponential function and ${\sin}|_{[0,1]}$. This is a weaker analogue of the precise characterisation of ordinary periods as numbers whose real and imaginary part are up to signs volumes of $\mathbb{Q}$-semi-algebraic sets. Furthermore, we define a notion of naive exponential periods and compare it to the existing notions using cohomological methods. This points to a relation between the theory of periods and o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>The Character Map in Equivariant Twistorial Cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- may remain underappreciated as a cohomology theory.
  In illustration and amplification of its cohomological nature, we construct the non-abelian generalization of the Chern character map on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantized 7-Cohomotopy -- in fact on its "twistorial" version classified by complex projective 3-space -- essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model, and we highlight some interesting integral cohomology classes which are extracted this way.
  We end with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

Abstract: Following the idea of [Far16], we develop the foundations of the geometric Langlands program on the Fargues--Fontaine curve. In particular, we define a category of $\ell$-adic sheaves on the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$ of $G$-bundles on the Fargues--Fontaine curve, prove a geometric Satake equivalence over the Fargues--Fontaine curve, and study the stack of $L$-parameters. As applications, we prove finiteness results for the cohomology of local Shimura varieties and general moduli spaces of local shtukas, and define $L$-parameters associated with irreducible smooth representations of $G(E)$, a map from the spectral Bernstein center to the Bernstein center, and the spectral action of the category of perfect complexes on the stack of $L$-parameters on the category of $\ell$-adic sheaves on $\mathrm{Bun}_G$.</description>

      <title>Quark Density in Lattice QC$_2$D at Imaginary and Real Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study lattice two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) with two flavors of staggered fermions at imaginary and real quark chemical potential $\mu_q$ and $T&gt;T_c$. We employ various methods of extrapolation of the quark number density from imaginary to real quark chemical potentials $\mu_q$, including series expansions as well as analytic continuation based on phenomenological models, and study their accuracy by comparing the results to the lattice data. Below the Roberge-Weiss temperature, $T&lt;T_{RW}$, we find that the cluster expansion model provides an accurate analytic continuation of the baryon number density in the studied range of chemical potentials. On the other hand, the behavior of the reconstructed canonical partition functions indicates that the available models may require corrections at high quark densities. At $T&gt;T_{RW}$ we show that the analytic continuation to the real values of $\mu_q$ based on trigonometric functions works equally well with the conventional method based on the Taylor expansion in powers of $\mu_q$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>Energetic Explosions from Collisions of Stars at Relativistic Speeds in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider collisions occurring between stars moving near the speed of light around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $M_{\bullet}\gtrsim10^8\,M_\odot$, without being tidally disrupted. In this SMBH range, for sun-like stars, the tidal-disruption radius is smaller than the SMBH's event horizon; therefore we do not expect to observe tidal disruption events. Differential collision rates are calculated by defining probability distribution functions for various parameters such as the impact parameter, distance from SMBH at time of collision, relative velocity between the two colliding stars, and the masses of the two colliding stars. The relative velocity parameter is drawn from a distribution function for SMBHs. We integrate over all parameters to arrive at a total collision rate for a galaxy with a specific SMBH mass. We then consider how the stellar population in the vicinity of the SMBH is depleted and replenished over time, and calculate the effect on the collision rate over time. We calculate the differential collision rate as a function of total energy released, energy released per unit mass lost, and galactocentric radius. The overall rate for collisions taking place in the inner $\sim1$ pc of galaxies with $M_{\bullet}=10^8,10^9,10^{10}\,M_\odot$ are $\Gamma\sim2.2\times10^{-3},2.2\times10^{-4},4.7\times10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The most common collisions release energies on the order of $\sim10^{49}-10^{51}$ erg, with the energy distribution peaking at higher energies in galaxies with more massive SMBHs. In addition, we show example light curves for collisions with varying parameters, and find that the peak luminosity could reach or even exceed that of superluminous supernovae. Weaker events could initially be mistaken for low-luminosity supernovae.</description>

Abstract: We study certain toric Gorenstein varieties with isolated singularities which are the quotient spaces of generic unimodular representations by the one-dimensional torus, or by the product of the one-dimensional torus with a finite abelian group. Based on the works of \v{S}penko and Van den Bergh [Invent. Math. 210 (2017), no. 1, 3-67] and Mori and Ueyama [Adv. Math. 297 (2016), 54-92], we show that the singularity categories of these varieties admit tilting objects, and hence are triangle equivalent to the perfect categories of some finite dimensional algebras.</description>

Abstract: Let $N(X)$ be the number of integral zeros $(x_1,\dots,x_6)\in [-X,X]^6$ of $\sum_{1\le i\le 6} x_i^3$. Works of Hooley and Heath-Brown imply $N(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{3+\epsilon}$, if one assumes automorphy and GRH for certain Hasse--Weil $L$-functions. Assuming instead a natural large sieve inequality, we recover the same bound on $N(X)$. This is part of a more general statement, for diagonal cubic forms in $\geq 4$ variables, where we allow approximations to Hasse--Weil $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>ReforesTree: A Dataset for Estimating Tropical Forest Carbon Stock with Deep Learning and Aerial Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forest biomass is a key influence for future climate, and the world urgently needs highly scalable financing schemes, such as carbon offsetting certifications, to protect and restore forests. Current manual forest carbon stock inventory methods of measuring single trees by hand are time, labour, and cost-intensive and have been shown to be subjective. They can lead to substantial overestimation of the carbon stock and ultimately distrust in forest financing. The potential for impact and scale of leveraging advancements in machine learning and remote sensing technologies is promising but needs to be of high quality in order to replace the current forest stock protocols for certifications.
  In this paper, we present ReforesTree, a benchmark dataset of forest carbon stock in six agro-forestry carbon offsetting sites in Ecuador. Furthermore, we show that a deep learning-based end-to-end model using individual tree detection from low cost RGB-only drone imagery is accurately estimating forest carbon stock within official carbon offsetting certification standards. Additionally, our baseline CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art satellite-based forest biomass and carbon stock estimates for this type of small-scale, tropical agro-forestry sites. We present this dataset to encourage machine learning research in this area to increase accountability and transparency of monitoring, verification and reporting (MVR) in carbon offsetting projects, as well as scaling global reforestation financing through accurate remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a cavity-induced measurement of the exchange coupling in quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spin qubit arrays the exchange coupling can be harnessed to implement two-qubit gates and to realize intermediate-range qubit connectivity along a spin bus. In this work, we propose a scheme to characterize the exchange coupling between electrons in adjacent quantum dots. We investigate theoretically the transmission of a microwave resonator coupled to a triple quantum dot (TQD) occupied by two electrons. We assume that the right quantum dot (QD) is always occupied by one electron while the second electron can tunnel between the left and center QD. If the two electrons are in adjacent dots they interact via the exchange coupling. By means of analytical calculations we show that the transmission profile of the resonator directly reveals the value of the exchange coupling strength between two electrons. From perturbation theory up to second order we conclude that the exchange can still be identified in the presence of magnetic gradients. A valley splitting comparable to the inter-dot tunnel coupling will lead to further modifications of the cavity transmission dips that also depend on the valley phases.</description>

      <title>Approaching ideal visibility in singlet-triplet qubit operations using energy-selective tunneling-based Hamiltonian estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report energy selective tunneling readout-based Hamiltonian parameter estimation of a two-electron spin qubit in a GaAs quantum dot array. Optimization of readout fidelity enables a single-shot measurement time of 16 on average, with adaptive initialization and efficient qubit frequency estimation based on real-time Bayesian inference. For qubit operation in a frequency heralded mode, we observe a 40-fold increase in coherence time without resorting to dynamic nuclear polarization. We also demonstrate active frequency feedback with quantum oscillation visibility, single-shot measurement fidelity, and state initialization fidelity up to 97.7%, 99%, and over 99.7%, respectively. By pushing the sensitivity of the energy selective tunneling-based spin to charge conversion to the limit, the technique is useful for advanced quantum control protocols such as error mitigation schemes, where fast qubit parameter calibration with a large signal-to-noise ratio is crucial.</description>

      <title>On Manin-Schechtman orders related to directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization of weak Bruhat orders on permutations, in 1989 Manin and Schechtman introduced the notion of a higher Bruhat order on the $d$-element subsets of a set $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Among other results in this field, they proved that the set of such orders for $n,d$ fixed, endowed with natural local transformations, constitutes a poset with one minimal and one maximal elements. In this paper we consider a wider model, involving the so-called convex order on certain path systems in an acyclic directed graph, introduce local transformations, or flips, on such orders and prove that the resulting structure gives a poset with one minimal and one maximal elements as well, yielding a generalization of the above-mentioned classical result.</description>

      <title>Learning Disentangled Representation for One-shot Progressive Face Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although face swapping has attracted much attention in recent years, it remains a challenging problem. Existing methods leverage a large number of data samples to explore the intrinsic properties of face swapping without considering the semantic information of face images. Moreover, the representation of the identity information tends to be fixed, leading to suboptimal face swapping. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient method named FaceSwapper, for one-shot face swapping based on Generative Adversarial Networks. Our method consists of a disentangled representation module and a semantic-guided fusion module. The disentangled representation module comprises an attribute encoder and an identity encoder, which aims to achieve the disentanglement of the identity and attribute information. The identity encoder is more flexible, and the attribute encoder contains more attribute details than its competitors. Benefiting from the disentangled representation, FaceSwapper can swap face images progressively. In addition, semantic information is introduced into the semantic-guided fusion module to control the swapped region and model the pose and expression more accurately. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with fewer training samples. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/liqi-casia/FaceSwapper.</description>

      <title>MM-SEAL: A Large-scale Video Dataset of Multi-person Multi-grained Spatio-temporally Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel large-scale video dataset dubbed MM-SEAL for multi-person multi-grained spatio-temporal action localization among human daily life. We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of regulatory network dynamics: equilibria and saddle-node bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a combined combinatorial/numerical approach to studying equilibria and bifurcations in network models arising in Systems Biology. ODE models of the dynamics suffer from high dimensional parameters which presents a significant obstruction to studying the global dynamics via numerical methods. The main point of this paper is to demonstrate that adapting and combining classical techniques with recently developed combinatorial methods provides a richer picture of the global dynamics despite the high parameter dimension.
  Given a network topology describing state variables which regulate one another via monotone and bounded functions, we first use the {\em Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks} (DSGRN) software to obtain a combinatorial summary of the dynamics. This summary is coarse but global and we use this information as a first pass to identify ``interesting'' subsets of parameters in which to focus. We construct an associated ODE model with high parameter dimension using our {\em Network Dynamics Modeling and Analysis} (NDMA) Python library. We introduce algorithms for efficiently investigating the dynamics in these ODE models restricted to these parameter subsets. Finally, we perform a statistical validation of the method and several interesting dynamical applications including finding saddle-node bifurcations in a $54$ parameter model.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic and Twin-Width in Tournaments and Dense Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model checking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al. on ordered graphs. The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm which takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $&lt;$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,&lt;)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,&lt;)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments. Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of dynamical systems driven by Poisson random measures with periodic sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a nonlinear system governed by an ordinary differential equation under the combined influence of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small jump noise of size $\varepsilon, 0&lt; \varepsilon,\delta \ll 1.$ The noise is a combination of Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. The instantaneous rate of change of the state depends not only on its current value but on the most recent measurement of the state, as the state is measured at certain discrete-time instants. As $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0,$ the stochastic process of interest converges, in a suitable sense, to the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Next, the study of rescaled fluctuations of the stochastic process around its mean is found to vary depending on the relative rates of convergence of small parameters $\varepsilon, \delta$ in different asymptotic regimes. We show that the rescaled process converges, in a strong (path-wise) sense, to an effective process having an extra drift term capturing both the sampling and noise effect. Consequently, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process of interest, in terms of the effective process along with error bounds on the remainder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A smooth hypersurface over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is called Frobenius nonclassical if the image of every geometric point under the $q$-th Frobenius endomorphism remains in the unique hyperplane tangent to the point. In this paper, we establish sharp lower and upper bounds for the degrees of such hypersurfaces, give characterizations for those achieving the maximal degrees, and prove in the surface case that they are Hermitian when their degrees attain the minimum. We also prove that the set of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on a Frobenius nonclassical hypersurface form a blocking set with respect to lines, which indicates the existence of many $\mathbb{F}_q$-points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a strong derivable map and calculate its derivative by employing a result in our previous work on strong derivability of maps arising by functional calculus of an unbounded scalar type spectral operator $R$ in a Banach space and the generalization to complete locally convex spaces of a classical result valid in the Banach space context. We apply this result to obtain a sequence of integrals converging to an integral of a complete locally convex space extension of a map arising by functional calculus of $R$.</description>

Abstract: We study two classical representations of Artin's braid group and their modulo $p$ reductions. We use topological methods to show that the Gassner representation $\tau_n: B_n\to\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots, t_n^{\pm 1}])$ is faithful for all $n$, and furthermore that it is faithful modulo $p$ for all integers $p&gt;1$. We then give a novel proof that the Burau representation of $B_3$ is faithful modulo $p$ for all $p&gt;1$, and suggest applications to the modulo $p$ Burau representation for higher braid groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of Basic Feasible Functionals BFF is the second-order counterpart of the class of first-order functions computable in polynomial time. We present several implicit characterizations of BFF based on a typed programming language of terms. These terms may perform calls to non-recursive imperative procedures. The type discipline has two layers: the terms follow a standard simply-typed discipline and the procedures follow a standard tier-based type discipline. BFF consists exactly of the second-order functionals that are computed by typable and terminating programs. The completeness of this characterization surprisingly still holds in the absence of lambda-abstraction. Moreover, the termination requirement can be specified as a completeness-preserving instance, which can be decided in time quadratic in the size of the program. As typing is decidable in polynomial time, we obtain the first tractable (i.e., decidable in polynomial time), sound, complete, and implicit characterization of BFF, thus solving a problem opened for more than 20 years.</description>

      <title>Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation over general regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel variant of hyperinterpolation, called hard thresholding hyperinterpolation. This approximation scheme of degree $n$ leverages a hard thresholding operator to filter all hyperinterpolation coefficients, which approximate the Fourier coefficients of a continuous function by a quadrature rule with algebraic exactness $2n$. We prove that hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is the unique solution to an $\ell_0$-regularized weighted discrete least squares approximation problem. Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is not only idempotent and commutative with hyperinterpolation, but also adheres to the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the discrete (semi) inner product. By the estimate of the reciprocal of Christoffel function, we present the upper bound of the uniform norm of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation operator. Additionally, hard thresholding hyperinterpolation possesses denoising and basis selection abilities akin to Lasso hyperinterpolation. To judge the $L_2$ errors of both hard thresholding and Lasso hyperinterpolations, we propose a criterion that integrates the regularization parameter with the product of noise coefficients and the signs of hyperinterpolation coefficients. Numerical examples on the sphere, spherical triangle and the cube demonstrate the denoising ability of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both quantum transport measurements in the Pauli blockade regime and microwave cavity transmission measurements are important tools for spin-qubit readout and characterization. Based on a generalized input-output theory we derive a theoretical framework to investigate how a double quantum dot (DQD) in a transport setup interacts with a coupled microwave resonator while the current through the DQD is rectified by Pauli blockade. We show that the output field of the resonator can be used to infer the leakage current and thus obtain insight into the blockade mechanisms. In the case of a silicon DQD, we show how the valley quasi-degeneracy can impose limitations on this scheme. We also demonstrate that a large number of unknown DQD parameters including (but not limited to) the valley splitting can be estimated from the resonator response simultaneous to a transport experiment, providing more detailed knowledge about the microscopic environment of the DQD. Furthermore, we describe and quantify a back-action of the resonator photons on the steady state leakage current.</description>

      <title>Fully Lattice-Linear Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Lattice-linearity was introduced as a way to model problems using predicates that induce a lattice among the global states (Garg, SPAA 2020). A key property of \textit{the predicate} representing such problems is that it induces \textit{one} lattice in the state space. An algorithm that emerges from such a predicate guarantees the execution to be correct even if nodes execute asynchronously. However, many interesting problems do not exhibit lattice-linearity. This issue was somewhat alleviated with the introduction of eventually lattice-linear algorithms (Gupta and Kulkarni, SSS 2021). They induce \textit{single} or \textit{multiple} lattices in \textit{a subset of the state space} even when the problem cannot be defined by a predicate under which the global states form a lattice.
  This paper focuses on analyzing and differentiating between lattice-linear problems and algorithms. We introduce \textit{fully lattice-linear algorithms}. These algorithms partition the \textit{entire} reachable state space into \textit{one or more lattices}, and as a result, ensure that the execution remains correct even if nodes execute asynchronously. For demonstration, we present lattice-linear self-stabilizing algorithms for minimal dominating set (MDS), graph colouring (GC), minimal vertex cover (MVC) and maximal independent set (MIS) problems.
  The algorithms for MDS, MVC and MIS converge in $n$ moves and the algorithm for GC converges in $n+2m$ moves. These algorithms preserve this time complexity while allowing the nodes to execute asynchronously. They present an improvement to the existing algorithms present in the literature.
  Our work also demonstrates that to allow asynchrony, a more relaxed data structure can be allowed (called $\prec$-lattice in this paper, where the meet of a pair of global states may not be defined), rather than a distributive lattice as assumed by Garg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi:X\rightarrow Z$ be a Fano type fibration with $\dim X-\dim Z=d$ and let $(X,B)$ be an $\epsilon$-lc pair with $K_X+B\sim_{\RR} 0/Z$. The canonical bundle formula gives $(Z,B_Z+M_Z)$ where $B_Z$ is the discriminant divisor and $M_Z$ is the moduli divisor which is determined up to $\RR$-linear equivalence. Shokurov conjectured that one can choose $M_Z\geq 0$ such that $(Z,B_Z+M_Z)$ is $\delta$-lc where $\delta$ only depends on $d,\epsilon$. Very recently, this conjecture was proved by Birkar \cite{Bir23}. For $d=1$ and $\epsilon=1$, Han, Jiang and Luo \cite{HJL22} gave the optimal value of $\delta=1/2$. In this paper, we give the optimal value of $\delta$ for $d=1$ and arbitrary $0&lt;\epsilon\leq 1$.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a fixed prime number, and $q$ a power of $p$. For any curve over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and any local system on it, we have a number field generated by the traces of Frobenii at closed points, known as the trace field. We show that as we range over all pointed curves of type $(g,n)$ in characteristic $p$ and rank two local systems satisfying a condition at infinity, the set of trace fields which are unramified at $p$ and of bounded degree is finite. This proves observations of Kontsevich obtained via numerical computations, which are in turn closely related to the analogue of Maeda's conjecture over function fields. The key ingredients of the proofs are Chin's theorem on independence of $\ell$ of monodromy groups, and the boundedness of abelian schemes of $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type over curves in positive characteristics, obtained using partial Hasse invariants; the latter is an analogue of Faltings' Arakelov theorem for abelian varieties in our setting.</description>

      <title>Discrete approximations to Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a half-space and norm resolvent convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend recent results on discrete approximations of the Laplacian in $\mathbf{R}^d$ with norm resolvent convergence to the corresponding results for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a half-space. The resolvents of the discrete Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians are embedded into the continuum using natural discretization and embedding operators. Norm resolvent convergence to their continuous counterparts is proven with a quadratic rate in the mesh size. These results generalize with a limited rate to also include operators with a real, bounded, and H\"older continuous potential, as well as certain functions of the Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians, including any positive real power.

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02603v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Centered Hybrid Data-Driven Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Nuclear Reactor Power Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient modeling of nuclear reactor transients is crucial for ensuring safe and optimal reactor operation. Traditional physics-based models, while valuable, can be computationally intensive and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world reactor behavior. This paper introduces a novel hybrid digital twin-focused multi-stage deep learning framework that addresses these limitations, offering a faster and more robust solution for predicting the final steady-state power of reactor transients. By leveraging a combination of feed-forward neural networks with both classification and regression stages, and training on a unique dataset that integrates real-world measurements of reactor power and controls state from the Missouri University of Science and Technology Reactor (MSTR) with noise-enhanced simulated data, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy (96% classification, 2.3% MAPE). The incorporation of simulated data with noise significantly improves the model's generalization capabilities, mitigating the risk of overfitting. Designed as a digital twin supporting system, this framework integrates real-time, synchronized predictions of reactor state transitions, enabling dynamic operational monitoring and optimization. This innovative solution not only enables rapid and precise prediction of reactor behavior but also has the potential to revolutionize nuclear reactor operations, facilitating enhanced safety protocols, optimized performance, and streamlined decision-making processes. By aligning data-driven insights with the principles of digital twins, this work lays the groundwork for adaptable and scalable solutions in nuclear system management.</description>

      <title>Joint modeling of wind speed and wind direction through a conditional approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric near surface wind speed and wind direction play an important role in many applications, ranging from air quality modeling, building design, wind turbine placement to climate change research. It is therefore crucial to accurately estimate the joint probability distribution of wind speed and direction. In this work we develop a conditional approach to model these two variables, where the joint distribution is decomposed into the product of the marginal distribution of wind direction and the conditional distribution of wind speed given wind direction. To accommodate the circular nature of wind direction a von Mises mixture model is used; the conditional wind speed distribution is modeled as a directional dependent Weibull distribution via a two-stage estimation procedure, consisting of a directional binned Weibull parameter estimation, followed by a harmonic regression to estimate the dependence of the Weibull parameters on wind direction. A Monte Carlo simulation study indicates that our method outperforms an alternative method that uses periodic spline quantile regression in terms of estimation efficiency. We illustrate our method by using the output from a regional climate model to investigate how the joint distribution of wind speed and direction may change under some future climate scenarios.</description>

      <title>SuperFusion: Multilevel LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Long-Range HD Map Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic map generation of the environment is an essential component of autonomous driving. Existing methods have achieved good performance in this task by fusing different sensor modalities, such as LiDAR and camera. However, current works are based on raw data or network feature-level fusion and only consider short-range HD map generation, limiting their deployment to realistic autonomous driving applications. In this paper, we focus on the task of building the HD maps in both short ranges, i.e., within 30 m, and also predicting long-range HD maps up to 90 m, which is required by downstream path planning and control tasks to improve the smoothness and safety of autonomous driving. To this end, we propose a novel network named SuperFusion, exploiting the fusion of LiDAR and camera data at multiple levels. We use LiDAR depth to improve image depth estimation and use image features to guide long-range LiDAR feature prediction. We benchmark our SuperFusion on the nuScenes dataset and a self-recorded dataset and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods with large margins on all intervals. Additionally, we apply the generated HD map to a downstream path planning task, demonstrating that the long-range HD maps predicted by our method can lead to better path planning for autonomous vehicles. Our code has been released at https://github.com/haomo-ai/SuperFusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ratio $p=\eta_1/\eta_2$ of the pseudo-periods of the Weierstrass $\zeta$-function in dependence of the ratio $\tau=\omega_1/\omega_2$ of the generators of the underlying rank-2 lattice. We will give an explicit geometric description of the map $\tau\mapsto p(\tau)$. As a consequence, we obtain an explanation of a theorem by Heins who showed that $p$ attains every value in the Riemann sphere infinitely often. Our main result is implicit in the classical literature, but it seems not to be very well known.
  Essentially, this is an expository paper. We hope that it is easily accessible and may serve as an introduction to these classical themes.</description>

      <title>Faster Accelerated First-order Methods for Convex Optimization with Strongly Convex Function Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce faster accelerated primal-dual algorithms for minimizing a convex function subject to strongly convex function constraints. Prior to our work, the best complexity bound was $\mathcal{O}(1/{\varepsilon})$, regardless of the strong convexity of the constraint function. It is unclear whether the strong convexity assumption can enable even better convergence results. To address this issue, we have developed novel techniques to progressively estimate the strong convexity of the Lagrangian function. Our approach, for the first time, effectively leverages the constraint strong convexity, obtaining an improved complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$. This rate matches the complexity lower bound for strongly-convex-concave saddle point optimization and is therefore order-optimal. We show the superior performance of our methods in sparsity-inducing constrained optimization, notably Google's personalized PageRank problem. Furthermore, we show that a restarted version of the proposed methods can effectively identify the optimal solution's sparsity pattern within a finite number of steps, a result that appears to have independent significance.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Framework for Neuro-Symbolic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12050v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of neuro-symbolic AI aims to benefit from the combination of neural networks and symbolic systems. A cornerstone of the field is the translation or encoding of symbolic knowledge into neural networks. Although many neuro-symbolic methods and approaches have been proposed, and with a large increase in recent years, no common definition of encoding exists that can enable a precise, theoretical comparison of neuro-symbolic methods. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a semantic framework for neuro-symbolic AI. We start by providing a formal definition of semantic encoding, specifying the components and conditions under which a knowledge-base can be encoded correctly by a neural network. We then show that many neuro-symbolic approaches are accounted for by this definition. We provide a number of examples and correspondence proofs applying the proposed framework to the neural encoding of various forms of knowledge representation. Many, at first sight disparate, neuro-symbolic methods, are shown to fall within the proposed formalization. This is expected to provide guidance to future neuro-symbolic encodings by placing them in the broader context of semantic encodings of entire families of existing neuro-symbolic systems. The paper hopes to help initiate a discussion around the provision of a theory for neuro-symbolic AI and a semantics for deep learning.</description>

      <title>Stochastic entropy production associated with quantum measurement in a framework of Markovian quantum state diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduced density matrix that characterises the state of an open quantum system is a projection from the full density matrix of the quantum system and its environment, and there are many full density matrices consistent with a given reduced version. Without a specification of relevant details of the environment, the evolution of a reduced density matrix is therefore typically unpredictable, even if the dynamics are deterministic. With this in mind, we investigate a two level open quantum system using a framework of quantum state diffusion. We consider the pseudorandom evolution of its reduced density matrix when subjected to an environment-driven process of continuous quantum measurement of a system observable, using dynamics that asymptotically send the system to an eigenstate. The unpredictability is characterised by a stochastic entropy production, the average of which corresponds to an increase in the subjective uncertainty of the quantum state adopted by the system and environment, given the underspecified dynamics. This differs from a change in von Neumann entropy, and can continue indefinitely as the system is guided towards an eigenstate. As one would expect, the simultaneous measurement of two non-commuting observables within the same framework does not send the system to an eigenstate. Instead, the probability density function describing the reduced density matrix of the system becomes stationary over a continuum of pure states, a situation characterised by zero further stochastic entropy production. Transitions between such stationary states, brought about by changes in the relative strengths of the two measurement processes, give rise to finite positive mean stochastic entropy production. The framework investigated can offer useful perspectives on both the dynamics and irreversible thermodynamics of measurement in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Let $L$ be a L\'evy operator. A function $h$ is said to be harmonic with respect to $L$ if $L h = 0$ in an appropriate sense. We prove Liouville's theorem for positive functions harmonic with respect to a general L\'evy operator $L$: such functions are necessarily mixtures of exponentials. For signed harmonic functions we provide a fairly general result, which encompasses and extends all Liouville-type theorems previously known in this context, and which allows to trade regularity assumptions on $L$ for growth restrictions on $h$. Finally, we construct an explicit counterexample which shows that Liouville's theorem for signed functions harmonic with respect to a general L\'evy operator $L$ does not hold.</description>

Abstract: Multi-structural (MS) games are combinatorial games that capture the number of quantifiers of first-order sentences. On the face of their definition, MS games differ from Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse (EF) games in two ways: first, MS games are played on two sets of structures, while EF games are played on a pair of structures; second, in MS games, Duplicator can make any number of copies of structures. In the first part of this paper, we perform a finer analysis of MS games and develop a closer comparison of MS games with EF games. In particular, we point out that the use of sets of structures is of the essence and that when MS games are played on pairs of structures, they capture Boolean combinations of first-order sentences with a fixed number of quantifiers. After this, we focus on another important difference between MS games and EF games, namely, the necessity for Spoiler to play on top of a previous move in order to win some MS games. Via an analysis of the types realized during MS games, we delineate the expressive power of the variant of MS games in which Spoiler never plays on top of a previous move. In the second part we focus on simultaneously capturing number of quantifiers and number of variables in first-order logic. We show that natural variants of the MS game do *not* achieve this. We then introduce a new game, the quantifier-variable tree game, and show that it simultaneously captures the number of quantifiers and number of variables. We conclude by generalizing this game to a family of games, the *syntactic games*, that simultaneously capture reasonable syntactic measures and the number of variables.</description>

      <title>Stability of Euclidean 3-space for the positive mass theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{R}^3$ is stable for the Positive Mass Theorem in the following sense. Let $(M_i,g_i)$ be a sequence of complete asymptotically flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and suppose that the ADM mass $m(g_i)$ of one end of $M_i$ converges to $0$. Then for all $i$, there is a subset $Z_i$ in $M_i$ such that $M_i\setminus Z_i$ contains the given end, the area of the boundary $\partial Z_i$ converges to zero, and $(M_i\setminus Z_i,g_i)$ converges to $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology for any choice of basepoints. This confirms a conjecture of G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen. Additionally, we find an almost quadratic upper bound for the area of $\partial Z_i$ in terms of $m(g_i)$. As an application of the main result, we also prove R. Bartnik's strict positivity conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08913v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large pre-trained image-processing neural networks are being embedded in autonomous agents such as self-driving cars or robots, the question arises of how such systems can communicate with each other about the surrounding world, despite their different architectures and training regimes. As a first step in this direction, we systematically explore the task of referential communication in a community of heterogeneous state-of-the-art pre-trained visual networks, showing that they can develop, in a self-supervised way, a shared protocol to refer to a target object among a set of candidates. This shared protocol can also be used, to some extent, to communicate about previously unseen object categories of different granularity. Moreover, a visual network that was not initially part of an existing community can learn the community's protocol with remarkable ease. Finally, we study, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the properties of the emergent protocol, providing some evidence that it is capturing high-level semantic features of objects.</description>

      <title>QP Chaser: Polynomial Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions. This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP). Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the target's center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02236v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a class of orbitally stable bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions. These solutions are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile which in itself is obtained via a doubly constrained energy minimization. One of the two constraints imposed is the total mass, while the other is given by the expectation value of the angular momentum around the z-axis. Our approach also allows for a new description of the set of minimizers subject to only a single mass constraint.</description>

      <title>kNN-Res: Residual Neural Network with kNN-Graph coherence for point cloud registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method based on a residual neural network for point set registration that preserves the topological structure of the target point set. Similar to coherent point drift (CPD), the registration (alignment) problem is viewed as the movement of data points sampled from a target distribution along a regularized displacement vector field. Although the coherence constraint in CPD is stated in terms of local motion coherence, the proposed regularization relies on a global smoothness constraint as a proxy for preserving local topology. This makes CPD less flexible when the deformation is locally rigid but globally non-rigid as in the case of multiple objects and articulate pose registration. A kNN-graph coherence cost and geometric-aware statistical distances are proposed to mitigate these issues. To create an end-to-end trainable pipeline, a simple Jacobian-based cost is introduced as a proxy for the intrinsically discrete kNN-graph cost. We present a theoretical justification for our Jacobian-based cost showing that it is sufficient for the preservation of the kNN-graph of the transformed point set. Further, to tackle the registration of high-dimensional point sets, a constant time stochastic approximation of the kNN-graph coherence cost is introduced. The proposed method is illustrated on several 2-dimensional examples and tested on high-dimensional flow cytometry datasets where the task is to align two distributions of cells whilst preserving the kNN-graph in order to preserve the biological signal of the transformed data. The implementation of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/MuhammadSaeedBatikh/kNN-Res_Demo/ under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Indoor VLC Network with Secure Downlink NOMA for Body Blockage Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks based on power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for mobile devices, where multiple legitimate users are equipped with photodiodes (PDs). We propose a body blockage model for both the legitimate users and eavesdropper to address scenarios where the communication links from transmitting light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to receiving devices are blocked by the bodies of all parties. Furthermore, in order to improve the secrecy without requiring knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper, we propose a novel LED arrangement that reduces the overlapping areas covered by different LED units supporting distinct users. We also suggest two LED transmission strategies, i.e., simple and smart LED linking, and compare their performance with the conventional broadcasting in terms of transmission sum rate and secrecy sum rate. Through computer simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategies to the conventional approach.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the concepts of spectral influence and spectral cyclicality, both derived from the largest eigenvalue of a graph's adjacency matrix. These two novel centrality measures capture both diffusion and interdependence from a local and global perspective respectively. We propose a new clustering algorithm that identifies communities with high cyclicality and interdependence, allowing for overlaps. To illustrate our method, we apply it to input-output analysis within the context of the Moroccan economy.</description>

      <title>Strategic Planning of Carbon-Neutral Heating Demand Coverage Under Uncertainty in a Coupled Multi-Energy Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating the gas and district heating with the electrical grid in a multi-energy grid has been shown to provide flexibility and prevent bottlenecks in the operation of electrical distribution grids. This integration assumes a top-down grid planning approach and a perfect knowledge of consumer behaviour. In reality, consumers decides whether to adopt a heating technology based on costs and government regulation. This behavior is highly uncertain and depends on fluctuations in heating technology costs and energy prices. The uncertainty associated with consumer behavior increases the risk of investment in grid expansion. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes an approach with the consumer at the center of the planning method. Robust optimization is used to model the uncertainty in prices to reduce the risk of investment in grid expansion. The uncertainty in energy prices is modeled using interval uncertainty with a proportional deviation. This allows planners, operators and regulators to predict the adoption rate of certain heating technology in different geographical areas and prioritize the expansion of specific grids where they are required. By minimizing a cost function subject to robust constraints, the strategy ensures robustness against uncertainties in energy prices. This robust optimization approach is applied to Hamburg as a case study. The result of the optimization represents the consumer's decision. The impact of the consumer's decision on the electrical grid is analzed on different benchmark distribution grids. The study concludes that district heating expansion in high-density areas is a low-risk investment for carbon neutrality. In less dense areas, electrification supports decentralized heat pumps. Meanwhile, hydrogen gas grids are viable where electric expansion is impractical. Increased uncertainty leads to more conservative solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the technique of categorical absorption of singularities we prove that the nontrivial components of the derived categories of del Pezzo threefolds of degree $d \in \{2,3,4,5\}$ and crepant categorical resolutions of the nontrivial components of the derived categories of nodal del Pezzo threefolds of degree $d = 1$ can be smoothly deformed to the nontrivial components of the derived categories of prime Fano threefolds of genus $g = 2d + 2 \in \{4,6,8,10,12\}$. This corrects and proves the Fano threefolds conjecture of the first author from [Kuz09], and opens a way to interesting geometric applications, including a relation between the intermediate Jacobians and Hilbert schemes of curves of the above threefolds. We also describe a compactification of the moduli stack of prime Fano threefolds endowed with an appropriate exceptional bundle and its boundary component that corresponds to degenerations associated with del Pezzo threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19353v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of stabilizing a leader-follower formation specified by a set of bearing constraints and being disturbed by some unknown uniformly bounded disturbance{s}. A set of leaders are positioned at their desired positions, while each follower is modeled by a single integrator with an additive time-varying disturbance. Adaptive variable-structure control laws using displacements or only bearing vectors are provided to stabilize the desired formation. Thanks to the adaptive mechanisms, the proposed control laws require neither information of the bearing Laplacian nor the disturbances' directions and upper bounds. It is further proved that when the leaders are moving with a same bounded uniformly continuous velocity, the moving target formation can still be achieved under the proposed control laws. Simulation results are also given to support the stability analysis.</description>

Abstract: We propose a paradigm of multiplexed dispersive qubit measurement performed while the qubits dephase. A Laplace transformation of the time-dependent cavity response allows to separate contributions from multiple qubits coupled to the same resonator mode, thus allowing for simultaneous single-shot read out. With realistic parameters for silicon spin qubits we find a competitive readout fidelity, while the measurement time compares favourably to conventional dispersive readout. We extend the multiplexed readout method to quantum non-demolition measurements using auxiliary qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents novel solutions for the efficient and reliable transmission of 3D point clouds over wireless channels. We first propose SEPT for the transmission of small-scale point clouds, which encodes the point cloud via an iterative downsampling and feature extraction process. At the receiver, SEPT decoder reconstructs the point cloud with latent reconstruction and offset-based upsampling. A novel channel-adaptive module is proposed to allow SEPT to operate effectively over a wide range of channel conditions. Next, we propose OTA-NeRF, a scheme inspired by neural radiance fields. OTA-NeRF performs voxelization to the point cloud input and learns to encode the voxelized point cloud into a neural network. Instead of transmitting the extracted feature vectors as in the SEPT scheme, it transmits the learned neural network weights over the air in an analog fashion along with few hyperparameters that are transmitted digitally. At the receiver, the OTA-NeRF decoder reconstructs the original point cloud using the received noisy neural network weights. To further increase the bandwidth efficiency of the OTA-NeRF scheme, a fine-tuning algorithm is developed, where only a fraction of the neural network weights are retrained and transmitted. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that both the SEPT and the OTA-NeRF schemes achieve superior or comparable performance over the conventional approaches, where an octree-based or a learning-based point cloud compression scheme is concatenated with a channel code. As an additional advantage, both schemes mitigate the cliff and leveling effects making them particularly attractive for highly mobile scenarios, where accurate channel estimation is challenging if not impossible.</description>

      <title>CPT-Odd effects on the electromagnetic properties of charged leptons in the Standard Model Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of the CPT-Odd electroweak gauge sector of the Standard Model Extension on the electromagnetic properties of charged leptons is studied. This gauge sector is characterized by the $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ Lorentz violation (LV) coefficients, which have positive mass dimension because they are associated with a $U_Y(1)$-invariant and with an $SU_L(2)$-invariant dimension-three operators, respectively. We present a comprehensive study on the impact of this sector on the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) and the electric dipole moment (EDM) of charged leptons, up to second order in these LV coefficients, both at the tree and one-loop levels.The contributions of $O(k_i)$ to the MDM are found to be suppressed relative to the corresponding contributions to the EDM by approximately three orders of magnitude. Using a recent experimental limit on the electron EDM the $|(k_2)_0-|\mathbf{k_2}|\cos\theta_\gamma|&lt;0.86\, m_e$ bound was obtained. As far as the contributions of $O(k^2_i)$ are concerned, we find that the tree-level contributions are suppressed with respect to the one-loop ones by at least a factor of $\left(m^2_l/m^2_Z\right)$. We find that the contribution to the electron MDM is by far the dominant one, as it can be up to four and seven orders of magnitude greater than those of the muon and tau, respectively. The Lorentz coefficient $(k_{AF})_\mu$ of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw's QED is given by a linear combination of $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$. Assuming that $|k^2_1|, |k^2_2|\gg |k^2_{AF}|$ and taking $(k_{AF})_\mu=0$, which implies that $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ are collinear, we obtain an upper bound of $\left|\frac{ k^2_2}{m^2_e} \right|&lt;4.36\times 10^{-10}$. The fact that $k^2_2$ is an observer Lorentz invariant allows us to introduce a new-physics scale through $\sqrt{k^2_2}=\Lambda_{CPT}$, for which we obtain the upper limit $\Lambda_{CPT}&lt; 2.08 \times 10^{-5}\, m_e$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Hellings Downs correlation has been observed by different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, such as NANOGrav, European PTA, Parkes PTA, and Chinese PTA. These PTA measurements of the most precise pulsars within the Milky Way show the first evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave background of our Universe. We study the ultralight axion interpretation of the new discovery by investigating the gravitational wave from axion transitions between different energy levels of the gravitational atoms, which are composed of cosmic populated Kerr black holes and their surrounding axion clouds formed through the superradiant process. By Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate that this new observation naturally admits an ultralight axion interpretation around $10^{-21}$~eV, which is consistent in magnitude with the typical mass of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The recent O-RAN specifications promote the evolution of RAN architecture by function disaggregation, adoption of open interfaces, and instantiation of a hierarchical closed-loop control architecture managed by RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) entities. This paves the road to novel data-driven network management approaches based on programmable logic. Aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), novel solutions targeting traditionally unsolved RAN management issues can be devised. Nevertheless, the adoption of such smart and autonomous systems is limited by the current inability of human operators to understand the decision process of such AI/ML solutions, affecting their trust in such novel tools. eXplainable AI (XAI) aims at solving this issue, enabling human users to better understand and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent schemes, reducing the human-to-machine barrier. In this survey, we provide a summary of the XAI methods and metrics before studying their deployment over the O-RAN Alliance RAN architecture along with its main building blocks. We then present various use cases and discuss the automation of XAI pipelines for O-RAN as well as the underlying security aspects. We also review some projects/standards that tackle this area. Finally, we identify different challenges and research directions that may arise from the heavy adoption of AI/ML decision entities in this context, focusing on how XAI can help to interpret, understand, and improve trust in O-RAN operational networks.</description>

      <title>Quasi-crystalline order in vibrated granular matter</title>

Abstract: Quasi-crystals are aperiodic structures that present crystallographic properties which are not compatible with that of a single unit cell. Their revolutionary discovery in a metallic alloy, less than three decades ago, has required a full reconsideration of what we defined as a crystal structure. Surprisingly, quasi-crystalline structures have been discovered also at much larger length scales in different microscopic systems for which the size of elementary building blocks ranges between the nanometric to the micrometric scale. Here, we report the first experimental observation of spontaneous quasi-crystal self-assembly at the millimetric scale. This result is obtained in a fully athermal system of macroscopic spherical grains vibrated on a substrate. Starting from a liquid-like disordered phase, the grains begin to locally arrange into three types of squared and triangular tiles that eventually align, forming 8-fold symmetric quasi-crystal that has been predicted in simulation but not yet observed experimentally in non-atomic systems. These results are not only the proof of a novel route to spontaneously assemble quasi-crystals but are of fundamental interest for the connection between equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Global existence and optimal time decay rate to one-dimensional two-phase flow model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and optimal time decay rate of solution to the one-dimensional (1D) two-phase flow described by compressible Euler equations coupled with compressible Navier-Stokes equations through the relaxation drag force on the momentum equations (Euler-Navier-Stokes system). First, we prove the global existence of a strong solution and the stability of the constant equilibrium state to 1D Cauchy problem of compressible Euler-Navier-Stokes system by using the standard continuity argument for small $H^{1}$ data while its second order derivative can be large. Then we derive the optimal time decay rate to the constant equilibrium state. Compared with the multi-dimensional case, it is much harder to get the optimal time decay rate by the direct spectrum method due to a slower convergence rate of the fundamental solution in the 1D case. To overcome this main difficulty, we need to first carry out time-weighted energy estimates (not optimal) for higher order derivatives, and based on these time-weighted estimates, we can close a priori assumptions and get the optimal time decay rate by spectral analysis method. Moreover, due to the non-conserved form and insufficient decay rate of the coupled drag force terms between the two-phase flows, we essentially need to use momentum variables $(m= \rho u, M=n\omega)$, rather than velocity variables $(u, \omega)$ in the spectrum analysis, to fully cancel out those non-conserved and insufficient time decay drag force terms.</description>

      <title>Atlas-Based Interpretable Age Prediction In Whole-Body MR Images</title>

Abstract: Age prediction is an important part of medical assessments and research. It can aid in detecting diseases as well as abnormal ageing by highlighting potential discrepancies between chronological and biological age. To improve understanding of age-related changes in various body parts, we investigate the ageing of the human body on a large scale by using whole-body 3D images. We utilise the Grad-CAM method to determine the body areas most predictive of a person's age. In order to expand our analysis beyond individual subjects, we employ registration techniques to generate population-wide importance maps that show the most predictive areas in the body for a whole cohort of subjects. We show that the investigation of the full 3D volume of the whole body and the population-wide analysis can give important insights into which body parts play the most important roles in predicting a person's age. Our findings reveal three primary areas of interest: the spine, the autochthonous back muscles, and the cardiac region, which exhibits the highest importance. Finally, we investigate differences between subjects that show accelerated and decelerated ageing.</description>

Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Observatory (JUNO) is a 20-kton liquid scintillator detector that employs 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as photon sensors, with 5,000 dynode-PMTs from HAMAMATSU Photonics K.K. (HPK), and 15,000 MCP-PMTs from North Night Vision Technology (NNVT) installed in pure water. JUNO aims to provide long-lasting and the best performance operation by utilizing a high-transparency liquid scintillator, high detection efficiency PMTs, and specially designed electronics including water-proof potting for the high voltage (HV) dividers of PMTs. In this paper, we present a summary of the design and optimization of HV dividers for both types of 20-inch PMTs, which includes collection efficiency, charge resolution, HV divider current, pulse shape, and maximum amplitude restriction. We have developed and finalized four schemes of the HV divider for different scenarios, including the final version selected by JUNO. All 20,000 20-inch PMTs have successfully undergone production and burning tests.</description>

      <title>Design principles of transcription factors with intrinsically disordered regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription Factors (TFs) are proteins crucial for regulating gene expression. Effective regulation requires the TFs to rapidly bind to their correct target, enabling the cell to respond efficiently to stimuli such as nutrient availability or the presence of toxins. However, the search process is hindered by slow diffusive movement and the presence of `false' targets --DNA segments that are similar to the true target. In eukaryotic cells, most TFs contain an Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), which is a long, flexible polymeric tail composed of hundreds of amino acids. Recent experimental findings indicate that the IDR of certain TFs plays a pivotal role in the search process. However, the principles underlying the IDR's role remain unclear. Here, we reveal key design principles of the IDR related to TF binding affinity and search time. Our results demonstrate that the IDR significantly enhances both of these aspects. Furthermore, our model shows good agreement with experimental results, and we propose further experiments to validate the model's predictions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced localization in the prethermal regime of continuously measured many-body localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localized systems exhibit a unique characteristic of avoiding thermalization, primarily attributed to the presence of a local disorder potential in the Hamiltonian. In recent years there has been an interest in simulating these systems on quantum devices. However, actual quantum devices are subject to unavoidable decoherence that can be modeled as coupling to a bath or continuous measurements. The quantum Zeno effect is also known to inhibit thermalization in a quantum system, where repeated measurements suppress transport. In this work we study the interplay of many-body localization and the many-body quantum Zeno effect. In a prethermal regime, we find that signatures of many-body localization are enhanced when the system is coupled to a bath that contains measurements of local fermion population, subject to the appropriate choice of system and bath parameters.</description>

      <title>CIF-T: A Novel CIF-based Transducer Architecture for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNN-T models are widely used in ASR, which rely on the RNN-T loss to achieve length alignment between input audio and target sequence. However, the implementation complexity and the alignment-based optimization target of RNN-T loss lead to computational redundancy and a reduced role for predictor network, respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel model named CIF-Transducer (CIF-T) which incorporates the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism with the RNN-T model to achieve efficient alignment. In this way, the RNN-T loss is abandoned, thus bringing a computational reduction and allowing the predictor network a more significant role. We also introduce Funnel-CIF, Context Blocks, Unified Gating and Bilinear Pooling joint network, and auxiliary training strategy to further improve performance. Experiments on the 178-hour AISHELL-1 and 10000-hour WenetSpeech datasets show that CIF-T achieves state-of-the-art results with lower computational overhead compared to RNN-T models.</description>

      <title>EnrichEvent: Enriching Social Data with Contextual Information for Emerging Event Extraction</title>

Abstract: Social platforms have emerged as crucial platforms for disseminating information and discussing real-life social events, offering researchers an excellent opportunity to design and implement novel event detection frameworks. However, most existing approaches only exploit keyword burstiness or network structures to detect unspecified events. Thus, they often need help identifying unknown events regarding the challenging nature of events and social data. Social data, e.g., tweets, is characterized by misspellings, incompleteness, word sense ambiguation, irregular language, and variation in aspects of opinions. Moreover, extracting discriminative features and patterns for evolving events by exploiting the limited structural knowledge is almost infeasible. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely EnrichEvent, that leverages the linguistic and contextual representations of streaming social data. In particular, we leverage contextual and linguistic knowledge to detect semantically related tweets and enhance the effectiveness of the event detection approaches. Eventually, our proposed framework produces cluster chains for each event to show the evolving variation of the event through time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our framework, validating its high performance and effectiveness in detecting and distinguishing unspecified social events.</description>

      <title>Single Proxy Synthetic Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic control methods are widely used to estimate the treatment effect on a single treated unit in time-series settings. A common approach to estimate synthetic control weights is to regress the treated unit's pre-treatment outcome and covariates' time series measurements on those of untreated units via ordinary least squares. However, this approach can perform poorly if the pre-treatment fit is not near perfect, whether the weights are normalized or not. In this paper, we introduce a single proxy synthetic control approach, which views the outcomes of untreated units as proxies of the treatment-free potential outcome of the treated unit, a perspective we leverage to construct a valid synthetic control. Under this framework, we establish an alternative identification strategy and corresponding estimation methods for synthetic controls and the treatment effect on the treated unit. Notably, unlike existing proximal synthetic control methods, which require two types of proxies for identification, ours relies on a single type of proxy, thus facilitating its practical relevance. Additionally, we adapt a conformal inference approach to perform inference about the treatment effect, obviating the need for a large number of post-treatment observations. Lastly, our framework can accommodate time-varying covariates and nonlinear models. We demonstrate the proposed approach in a simulation study and a real-world application.</description>

      <title>A 3D deep learning classifier and its explainability when assessing coronary artery disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) could save lives and reduce healthcare costs. The current clinical practice is to perform CAD diagnosis through analysing medical images from computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Most current approaches utilise deep learning methods but require centerline extraction and multi-planar reconstruction. These indirect methods are not designed in a clinician-friendly manner, and they complicate the interventional procedure. Furthermore, the current deep learning methods do not provide exact explainability and limit the usefulness of these methods to be deployed in clinical settings. In this study, we first propose a 3D Resnet-50 deep learning model to directly classify normal subjects and CAD patients on CTCA images, then we demonstrate a 2D modified U-Net model can be subsequently employed to segment the coronary arteries. Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 21.43% in terms of classification accuracy. The classification model with focal loss provides a better and more focused heat map, and the segmentation model provides better explainability than the classification-only model. The proposed holistic approach not only provides a simpler and clinician-friendly solution but also good classification accuracy and exact explainability for CAD diagnosis.</description>

Abstract: Equipping the rototranslation group $SE(2)$ with a sub-Riemannian structure inspired by the visual cortex V1, we propose algorithms for image inpainting and enhancement based on hypoelliptic diffusion. We innovate on previous implementations of the methods by Citti, Sarti, and Boscain et al., by proposing an alternative that prevents fading and is capable of producing sharper results in a procedure that we call WaxOn-WaxOff. We also exploit the sub-Riemannian structure to define a completely new unsharp filter using $SE(2)$, analogous to the classical unsharp filter for 2D image processing. We demonstrate our method on blood vessels enhancement in retinal scans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain unknown. Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here, we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ~10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients, and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares, or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models.</description>

      <title>Efficient decoding of stabilizer code by single-qubit local operations and classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a protocol for extracting distributed one-qubit quantum information encoded in a stabilizer code of multiple qubits, only by single-qubit local operations and classical communication (LOCC) without global operations or entanglement resources. This protocol achieves efficient extraction within a polynomial time in terms of the number of physical qubits. We apply this protocol to a setting of quantum information splitting where a subset of spatially separated parties cooperate by classical communication to extract quantum information shared among all the parties. For this task, our LOCC extraction protocol allows designing hierarchical information access structures among the parties, where the minimum number of parties required to cooperate depends on the location of extracting the shared quantum information. These results provide a fundamental building block of distributed quantum information processing that requires access to distributed quantum information encoded in the stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral and flavored $Z^\prime$ from cosmic bursts through neutrino interactions</title>

Abstract: The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We consider $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking of $U(1)$ and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where $Z^\prime$ interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on $Z^\prime-$neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider $\nu \overline{\nu} \to e^+ e^-$ process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrain $U(1)$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and $Z^\prime$ mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$ under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study $\nu-$DM scattering through $Z^\prime$ to constrain $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-$\alpha$ data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane from scattering, beam-dump and $g-2$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hardware Implementation of Constant Time Sampling for HQC</title>

Abstract: HQC is one of the code-based finalists in the last round of the NIST post quantum cryptography standardization process. In this process, security and implementation efficiency are key metrics for the selection of the candidates. A critical compute kernel with respect to efficient hardware implementations and security in HQC is the sampling method used to derive random numbers. Due to its security criticality, recently an updated sampling algorithm was presented to increase its robustness against side-channel attacks.
  In this paper, we pursue a cross layer approach to optimize this new sampling algorithm to enable an efficient hardware implementation without comprising the original algorithmic security and side-channel attack robustness.
  We compare our cross layer based implementation to a direct hardware implementation of the original algorithm and to optimized implementations of the previous sampler version. All implementations are evaluated using the Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA. Our results show that our approach reduces the latency by a factor of 24 compared to the original algorithm and by a factor of 28 compared to the previously used sampler with significantly less resources.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Paolini and Shelah have constructed absolutely Hopfian torsion-free abelian groups of any given size. In contrast, we show that this is not necessarily the case for absolutely co-Hopfian groups. We use the infinitary logic to show that there are no absolute co-Hopfian abelian groups above the first beautiful cardinal. An extension of this result to the category of modules over a commutative ring is given.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Simple GNNs with Low Rank Non-parametric Aggregators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit recent spectral GNN approaches to semi-supervised node classification (SSNC). We posit that state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures may be over-engineered for common SSNC benchmark datasets (citation networks, page-page networks, etc.). By replacing feature aggregation with a non-parametric learner we are able to streamline the GNN design process and avoid many of the engineering complexities associated with SOTA hyperparameter selection (GNN depth, non-linearity choice, feature dropout probability, etc.). Our empirical experiments suggest conventional methods such as non-parametric regression are well suited for semi-supervised learning on sparse, directed networks and a variety of other graph types commonly found in SSNC benchmarks. Additionally, we bring attention to recent changes in evaluation conventions for SSNC benchmarking and how this may have partially contributed to rising performances over time.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture by Hoffman, White, and the first author regarding the uniqueness of pitchfork and helicoid translators of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We employ an arc-counting argument motivated by Morse-Rad\'o theory for translators and a rotational maximum principle. Applications to the classification of semigraphical translators in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and their limits are discussed, strengthening compactness results of the first author with Hoffman-White and with Gama-Moller.</description>

      <title>The dynamical lineage of field ultra-diffuse galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) exhibit morphological similarities with other low-luminosity galaxies indicating a possible evolutionary connection. We investigate for common dynamical characteristics of isolated, HI-rich UDGs with other low luminosity field galaxies, namely the low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) and the dwarf irregulars (dIrrs). From the galaxy scaling relation studies, we note that UDGs and LSBs constitute statistically different populations. However, for UDGs and dIrrs, the null hypotheses of these statistical tests cannot be rejected : stellar mass versus atomic hydrogen mass; stellar mass versus dynamical mass; and dark matter core density versus core radius mass scaling. Interestingly, the dynamical models suggest that UDGs, LSBs and dIrrs constitute different galaxy populations as reflected by their radial-to-vertical velocity dispersion, and the rotational velocity-to-total stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we observe that the total HI and stellar mass mostly regulate the variance in the structural and kinematical data both for the UDGs and dIrrs, while the ratio of radial-to-vertical velocity dispersion, and the total HI mass dominate the same in LSBs. UDGs and LSBs represent statistically different galaxy populations with respect to their mass and structural properties. But the fact that their structural parameters follow the same distributions is not ruled out. However, UDGs, dIrrs and LSBs constitute very different populations as far as their kinematical parameters are concerned. Finally, we note that the variation in the structural and kinematical data of both the UDGs and the dIrrs is mostly accounted for by their stellar mass and HI mass, whereas for the LSBs, the same is explained by the ratio of the radial-to-vertical stellar dispersion followed by the HI mass. Thus we conclude that the UDGs and dIrrs to share common dynamical lineage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Signed Graph Neural Networks through Curriculum-Based Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signed graphs are powerful models for representing complex relations with both positive and negative connections. Recently, Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have emerged as potent tools for analyzing such graphs. To our knowledge, no prior research has been conducted on devising a training plan specifically for SGNNs. The prevailing training approach feeds samples (edges) to models in a random order, resulting in equal contributions from each sample during the training process, but fails to account for varying learning difficulties based on the graph's structure. We contend that SGNNs can benefit from a curriculum that progresses from easy to difficult, similar to human learning. The main challenge is evaluating the difficulty of edges in a signed graph. We address this by theoretically analyzing the difficulty of SGNNs in learning adequate representations for edges in unbalanced cycles and propose a lightweight difficulty measurer. This forms the basis for our innovative Curriculum representation learning framework for Signed Graphs, referred to as CSG. The process involves using the measurer to assign difficulty scores to training samples, adjusting their order using a scheduler and training the SGNN model accordingly. We empirically our approach on six real-world signed graph datasets. Our method demonstrates remarkable results, enhancing the accuracy of popular SGNN models by up to 23.7% and showing a reduction of 8.4% in standard deviation, enhancing model stability.</description>

      <title>Classification of higher grade $\ell$ graphs for $\mathrm{U}(N)^2\times \mathrm{O}(D)$ multi-matrix models</title>

Abstract: The authors studied in [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e D 9, 367-433, (2022)], a complex multi-matrix model with $\mathrm{U}(N)^2 \times \mathrm{O}(D)$ symmetry, and whose double scaling limit where simultaneously the large-$N$ and large-$D$ limits were taken while keeping the ratio $N/\sqrt{D}=M$ finite and fixed. In this double scaling limit, the complete recursive characterization of the Feynman graphs of arbitrary genus for the leading order grade $\ell=0$ was achieved. In this current study, we classify the higher order graphs in $\ell$. More specifically, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ with arbitrary genus, in addition to a specific class of two-particle-irreducible (2PI) graphs for higher $\ell \geqslant 3$ but with genus zero. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each 2PI graph with a single $\mathrm{O}(D)$-loop with an arbitrary $\ell$ corresponds to a reduced alternating knot diagram with $\ell$ crossings as listed in the Rolfsen knot table, or a resulting alternating knot diagram obtained after performing the Tait flyping moves. We generalize to 2PR by considering the connected sum and the Reidemeister move I.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a holographic model in which the striped structure of charge density is spontaneously formed over an ionic lattice which breaks the translational symmetry explicitly. The effect of commensurate lock-in between the spontaneous stripes and the ionic lattice is observed when the lattice amplitude is large enough. We investigate the optical conductivity as a function of frequency in commensurate state and compare its characteristics during the phase transition from metallic phase to insulating phase. Notably, we find that the DC resistivity in lock-in state increases algebraically with lowering temperature, which is in line with the phenomenon observed in the holographic model for simulating the experimental behavior of Mott insulator in [Nature Phys. 14, no.10, 1049-1055 (2018)]. In addition, at lower temperature the pinning effect is observed for both unlock-in and lock-in states. This holographic model successfully demonstrates the commensurate lock-in signatures, and provides more information for understanding the interplay between ionic lattices and electronic lattices by holography.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Chirality of Vibrational Modes in Helical Molecular Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16352v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of quantitative methods for studying chirality has stunted our theoretical understanding of chirality-induced physical phenomena. The chiral phonon has been proposed to be involved in various physical phenomena, but it is not yet well defined mathematically. Here we examine two approaches for assigning and quantifying the chirality of molecular normal modes in double-helical molecular wires with various levels of twist. First, associating with each normal mode a structure obtained by imposing the corresponding motion on a common atomic origin, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to quantitatively assess the relationship between the chirality-weighted normal mode spectrum and the chirality of the underlying molecular structure. We find that increasing the amount of twist in the double helix shifts the mean normal mode CCM to drastically higher values, implying that the chirality of molecular normal modes is strongly correlated with that of the underlying molecular structure. Second, we assign to each normal mode a pseudoscaler defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms, and we analyze the handedness of the normal mode spectrum with respect to this quantity. We find that twisting the double-chain structure introduces asymmetry between right and left-handed normal modes so that in twisted structures different frequency bands are characterized by distinct handedness. This may give rise to global phenomena such as thermal chirality.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XIII. Basic obstructions in $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs for finite $\mathcal{H}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike minors, the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth come in a large variety, including, for every $t\geq 1$, the $t$-basic obstructions: the graphs $K_{t+1}$ and $K_{t,t}$, along with the subdivisions of the $t$-by-$t$ wall and their line graphs. But this list is far from complete. The simplest example of a ''non-basic'' obstruction is due to Pohoata and Davies (independently). For every $n \geq 1$, they construct certain graphs of treewidth $n$ and with no $3$-basic obstruction as an induced subgraph, which we call $n$-arrays.
  Let us say a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is clean if the only obstructions to bounded treewidth in $\mathcal{G}$ are in fact the basic ones. It follows that a full description of the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth is equivalent to a characterization of all families $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs for which the class of all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is clean (a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to any graph in $\mathcal{H}$).
  This remains elusive, but there is an immediate necessary condition: if $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs are clean, then there are only finitely many integers $n\geq 1$ such that there is an $n$-array which is $\mathcal{H}$-free. The above necessary condition is not sufficient in general. However, the situation turns out to be different if $\mathcal{H}$ is finite: we prove that for every finite set $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, the class of all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is clean if and only if there is no $\mathcal{H}$-free $n$-array except possibly for finitely many values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Maximal dimensional subalgebras of general Cartan type Lie algebras</title>

Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathbb{W}_n = \operatorname{Der}(\Bbbk[x_1,\cdots,x_n])$ be the $n^{\text{th}}$ general Cartan type Lie algebra. In this paper, we study Lie subalgebras $L$ of $\mathbb{W}_n$ of maximal Gelfand-Kirillov (GK) dimension, that is, with $\operatorname{GKdim}(L) = n$.
  For $n = 1$, we completely classify such $L$, proving a conjecture of the second author. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof that $\mathbb{W}_1$ satisfies the Dixmier conjecture, in other words, $\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{W}_1) \setminus \{0\} = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{W}_1)$, a result first shown by Du.
  For arbitrary $n$, we show that if $L$ is a GK-dimension $n$ subalgebra of $\mathbb{W}_n$, then $U(L)$ is not (left or right) noetherian.</description>

      <title>Quantum Griffiths singularity in a three-dimensional superconductor to Anderson critical insulator transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder is ubiquitous in real materials and can have dramatic effects on quantum phase transitions. Originating from the disorder enhanced quantum fluctuation, quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) has been revealed as a universal phenomenon in quantum criticality of low-dimensional superconductors. However, due to the weak fluctuation effect, QGS is very challenging to detect experimentally in three-dimensional (3D) superconducting systems. Here we report the discovery of QGS associated with the quantum phase transition from 3D superconductor to Anderson critical insulator in a spinel oxide MgTi2O4 (MTO). Under both perpendicular and parallel magnetic field, the dynamical critical exponent diverges when approaching the quantum critical point, demonstrating the existence of 3D QGS. Among 3D superconductors, MTO shows a relatively strong fluctuation effect featured as a wide superconducting transition region. The enhanced fluctuation, which may arise from the mobility edge of Anderson localization, finally leads to the occurrence of 3D quantum phase transition and QGS. Our findings offer a new perspective to understand quantum phase transitions in strongly disordered 3D systems.</description>

      <title>Activity Sparsity Complements Weight Sparsity for Efficient RNN Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks open up unprecedented machine learning capabilities at the cost of ever growing computational requirements. Sparsifying the parameters, often achieved through weight pruning, has been identified as a powerful technique to compress the number of model parameters and reduce the computational operations of neural networks. Yet, sparse activations, while omnipresent in both biological neural networks and deep learning systems, have not been fully utilized as a compression technique in deep learning. Moreover, the interaction between sparse activations and weight pruning is not fully understood. In this work, we demonstrate that activity sparsity can compose multiplicatively with parameter sparsity in a recurrent neural network model based on the GRU that is designed to be activity sparse. We achieve up to $20\times$ reduction of computation while maintaining perplexities below $60$ on the Penn Treebank language modeling task. This magnitude of reduction has not been achieved previously with solely sparsely connected LSTMs, and the language modeling performance of our model has not been achieved previously with any sparsely activated recurrent neural networks or spiking neural networks. Neuromorphic computing devices are especially good at taking advantage of the dynamic activity sparsity, and our results provide strong evidence that making deep learning models activity sparse and porting them to neuromorphic devices can be a viable strategy that does not compromise on task performance. Our results also drive further convergence of methods from deep learning and neuromorphic computing for efficient machine learning.</description>

      <title>MAgIC: Investigation of Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent in Cognition, Adaptability, Rationality and Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional reasoning, tool usage, and memory capabilities. As their applications expand into multi-agent environments, there arises a need for a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures LLMs' reasoning, planning, collaboration, and other social abilities. This work introduces a novel competition-based benchmark framework specifically designed to assess LLMs within multi-agent settings, providing quantitative metrics to evaluate their judgment, reasoning, deception, self-awareness, cooperation, coordination, and rationality. We utilize two social deduction games alongside three game-theory scenarios to create diverse environments. Our frame is fortified with the probabilistic graphic modeling (PGM) method, enhancing the LLMs' capabilities in navigating complex social and cognitive dimensions. We evaluate seven LLMs, quantitatively highlighting a significant capability gap of over threefold between the strongest, GPT o1, and the weakest, Llama-2-70B. It also confirms that our PGM enhancement boosts the abilities of all selected models by an average of 37%. Our data and code can be found here https://github.com/cathyxl/MAgIC.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Hoyle State Radiative Transition Width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative decay of the Hoyle state is the doorway to the production of heavier elements in stellar environment. Here we report, an exclusive measurement of electric quadruple (E$_2$) transitions of the Hoyle state to the ground state of $^{12}$C through the $^{12}$C(p, p$^\prime$$\gamma$$\gamma$)$^{12}$C reaction. Triple coincidence measurement yields a value of radiative branching ratio $\Gamma_{rad}$/$\Gamma$ = 4.01 (30) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The result has been corroborated by an independent experiment based on the complete kinematical measurement $via.$ $^{12}$C(p, p$^\prime$)$^{12}$C reaction ($\Gamma_{rad}$/$\Gamma$ = 4.04 (30) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$). Using our results together with the currently adopted values of $\Gamma_{\pi}$(E$_0$)/$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_{\pi}$($E_0$), the radiative width of the Hoyle state is found to be 3.75 (40) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ eV. We emphasize here that our result is not in agreement with 34 $\%$ increase in the radiative decay width of the Hoyle state measured recently but consistent with the currently adopted value.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Completeness in the Polynomial Hierarchy for many natural Problems in Bilevel and Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In bilevel and robust optimization we are concerned with combinatorial min-max problems, for example from the areas of min-max regret robust optimization, network interdiction, most vital vertex problems, blocker problems, and two-stage adjustable robust optimization. Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the classes $\Sigma^p_2$ or $\Sigma^p_3$ from the polynomial hierarchy, almost no hardness results in this regime are currently known. However, such complexity insights are important, since they imply that no polynomial-sized integer program for these min-max problems exist, and hence conventional IP-based approaches fail. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new $\Sigma^p_2$-complete and $\Sigma^p_3$-complete problems. The majority of all earlier publications on $\Sigma^p_2$- and $\Sigma^p_3$-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Precisely, we introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). We show that for every single of these problems, the corresponding min-max (i.e. interdiction/regret) variant is $\Sigma^p_2$- and the min-max-min (i.e. two-stage) variant is $\Sigma^p_3$-complete.</description>

      <title>SelfEval: Leveraging the discriminative nature of generative models for evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an automated way to evaluate the text alignment of text-to-image generative diffusion models using standard image-text recognition datasets. Our method, called SelfEval, uses the generative model to compute the likelihood of real images given text prompts, and the likelihood can be used to perform recognition tasks with the generative model. We evaluate generative models on standard datasets created for multimodal text-image discriminative learning and assess fine-grained aspects of their performance: attribute binding, color recognition, counting, shape recognition, spatial understanding. Existing automated metrics rely on an external pretrained model like CLIP (VLMs) or LLMs, and are sensitive to the exact pretrained model and its limitations. SelfEval sidesteps these issues, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated metric to show a high degree of agreement for measuring text-faithfulness with the gold-standard human evaluations across multiple generative models, benchmarks and evaluation metrics. SelfEval also reveals that generative models showcase competitive recognition performance on challenging tasks such as Winoground image-score compared to discriminative models. We hope SelfEval enables easy and reliable automated evaluation for diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Essential loops in completions of Hamiltonian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the fundamental group of natural completions of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, namely its $C^0$-closure $\overline{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ and its completion with respect to the spectral norm $\widehat{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$. We prove that in some situations, namely complex projective spaces and rational Hirzebruch surfaces, certain Hamiltonian loops that were known to be non-trivial in $\pi_1\big(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\big)$ remain non-trivial in $\pi_1\big(\widehat{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)\big)$. This yields in particular cases, including $\mathbb C\mathrm P^2$ and the monotone $S^2\times S^2$, the injectivity of the map $\pi_1\big(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\big)\to\pi_1\big(\widehat{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)\big)$ induced by the inclusion. The same results hold for the Hofer completion of $\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)$. Moreover, whenever the spectral norm is known to be $C^0$-continuous, they also hold for $\overline{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$.
  Our method relies on computations of the valuation of Seidel elements and hence of the spectral norm on $\pi_1\big(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\big)$. Some of these computations were known before, but we also present new ones which might be of independent interest. For example, we show that the spectral pseudo-norm is degenerate when $(M,\omega)$ is any non-monotone $S^{2}\times S^{2}$. At the contrary, it is a genuine norm when $M$ is the 1-point blow-up of $\mathbb C\mathrm P^{2}$; it is unbounded for small sizes of the blow-up and become bounded starting at the monotone one.</description>

      <title>Applications of Spiking Neural Networks in Visual Place Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robotics, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their largely-unrealized potential energy efficiency and low latency particularly when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We demonstrate competitive performance of our method on a range of datasets, including higher responsiveness to ensembling compared to conventional VPR techniques and higher R@1 improvements with sequence matching than VPR techniques with comparable baseline performance. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, and paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>GSE: Group-wise Sparse and Explainable Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse adversarial attacks fool deep neural networks (DNNs) through minimal pixel perturbations, often regularized by the $\ell_0$ norm. Recent efforts have replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as the nuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. The resulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practical relevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs. However, crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computing norms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. We address this by presenting a two-phase algorithm that generates group-wise sparse attacks within semantically meaningful areas of an image. Initially, we optimize a quasinorm adversarial loss using the $1/2-$quasinorm proximal operator tailored for non-convex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to a projected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2-$norm regularization applied to perturbation magnitudes. Rigorous evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity, e.g., $50.9\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $38.4\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack). This performance improvement is accompanied by significantly faster computation times, improved explainability, and a $100\%$ attack success rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ContinuityCam, a novel approach to generate a continuous video from a single static RGB image and an event camera stream. Conventional cameras struggle with high-speed motion capture due to bandwidth and dynamic range limitations. Event cameras are ideal sensors to solve this problem because they encode compressed change information at high temporal resolution. In this work, we tackle the problem of event-based continuous color video decompression, pairing single static color frames and event data to reconstruct temporally continuous videos. Our approach combines continuous long-range motion modeling with a neural synthesis model, enabling frame prediction at arbitrary times within the events. Our method only requires an initial image, thus increasing the robustness to sudden motions, light changes, minimizing the prediction latency, and decreasing bandwidth usage. We also introduce a novel single-lens beamsplitter setup that acquires aligned images and events, and a novel and challenging Event Extreme Decompression Dataset (E2D2) that tests the method in various lighting and motion profiles. We thoroughly evaluate our method by benchmarking color frame reconstruction, outperforming the baseline methods by 3.61 dB in PSNR and by 33% decrease in LPIPS, as well as showing superior results on two downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Adaptive Teacher for Domain Adaptive Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an effective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research. Deep neural networks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative labeled data for various applications. In IFD, they achieve high classification performance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive domain knowledge. However, deep learning models usually only perform well on the data distribution they have been trained on. When applied to a different distribution, they may experience performance drops. This is also observed in IFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those in which labeled data have been collected. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) deals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain, and only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may correspond to operating conditions. Recent methods rely on training with confident pseudo-labels for target samples. However, the confidence-based selection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence estimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions, which limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network throughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration techniques. We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive experiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most transfer tasks.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Particles Anomaly Detection with Parametrized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility to apply quantum machine learning techniques for data analysis, with particular regard to an interesting use-case in high-energy physics. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on a parametrized quantum circuit. This algorithm has been trained on a classical computer and tested with simulations as well as on real quantum hardware. Tests on NISQ devices have been performed with IBM quantum computers. For the execution on quantum hardware specific hardware driven adaptations have been devised and implemented. The quantum anomaly detection algorithm is able to detect simple anomalies like different characters in handwritten digits as well as more complex structures like anomalous patterns in the particle detectors produced by the decay products of long-lived particles produced at a collider experiment. For the high-energy physics application, performance is estimated in simulation only, as the quantum circuit is not simple enough to be executed on the available quantum hardware. This work demonstrates that it is possible to perform anomaly detection with quantum algorithms, however, as amplitude encoding of classical data is required for the task, due to the noise level in the available quantum hardware, current implementation cannot outperform classic anomaly detection algorithms based on deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Strong Error Bounds for Trotter &amp; Strang-Splittings and Their Implications for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient error estimates for the Trotter product formula are central in quantum computing, mathematical physics, and numerical simulations. However, the Trotter error's dependency on the input state and its application to unbounded operators remains unclear. Here, we present a general theory for error estimation, including higher-order product formulas, with explicit input state dependency. Our approach overcomes two limitations of the existing operator-norm estimates in the literature. First, previous bounds are too pessimistic as they quantify the worst-case scenario. Second, previous bounds become trivial for unbounded operators and cannot be applied to a wide class of Trotter scenarios, including atomic and molecular Hamiltonians. Our method enables analytical treatment of Trotter errors in chemistry simulations, illustrated through a case study on the hydrogen atom. Our findings reveal: (i) for states with fat-tailed energy distribution, such as low-angular-momentum states of the hydrogen atom, the Trotter error scales worse than expected (sublinearly) in the number of Trotter steps; (ii) certain states do not admit an advantage in the scaling from higher-order Trotterization, and thus, the higher-order Trotter hierarchy breaks down for these states, including the hydrogen atom's ground state; (iii) the scaling of higher-order Trotter bounds might depend on the order of the Hamiltonians in the Trotter product for states with fat-tailed energy distribution. Physically, the enlarged Trotter error is caused by the atom's ionization due to the Trotter dynamics. Mathematically, we find that certain domain conditions are not satisfied by some states so higher moments of the potential and kinetic energies diverge. Our analytical error analysis agrees with numerical simulations, indicating that we can estimate the state-dependent Trotter error scaling genuinely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under certain hypotheses, we show that Legendrian surfaces related by disk surgery will have q-deformed augmentation spaces that are related by q-deformed cluster transformation. The proof is geometric, via considerations of moduli of holomorphic curves. In fact, our results naturally give a more general HOMFLYPT "skein-valued cluster transformation", of which the q-cluster transformation is the U(1) specialization.
  We apply our methods to the Legendrians associated to cubic planar graphs, where mutation of graphs lifts to Legendrian disk surgery. We show that their skein-valued mirrors transform by skein-valued cluster transformation, and give a formula for the skein-valued curve counts on their fillings.</description>

      <title>Quantum transition probability in convex sets and self-dual cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between the algebraic structure (operator algebras) for the quantum observables and the convex structure of the state space has been explored for a long time and most advanced results are due to Alfsen and Shultz. Here we present a more elementary approach with a more generic structure for the observables, which focuses on the transition probability of the quantum logical atoms. The binary case gives rise to the generalized qubit models and was fully developed in a preceding paper. Here we consider any case with finite information capacity (binary means that the information capacity is 2). A novel geometric property that makes any compact convex set a matching state space is presented. Generally, the transition probability is not symmetric; if it is symmetric, we get an inner product and a self-dual cone. The emerging mathematical structure comes close to the Euclidean Jordan algebras and becomes a new mathematical model for a potential extension of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement smectic and stripe order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking and more recently entanglement are two cornerstones of quantum matter. We introduce the notion of anisotropic entanglement ordered phases, where the spatial profile of spin-pseudospin entanglement spontaneously lowers the four-fold rotational symmetry of the underlying crystal to a two-fold one, while the charge density retains the full symmetry. The resulting phases, which we term $\textit{entanglement smectic}$ and $\textit{entanglement stripe}$, exhibit a rich Goldstone mode spectrum and a set of phase transitions as a function of underlying anisotropies. We discuss experimental consequences of such anisotropic entanglement phases distinguishing them from more conventional charge or spin stripes. Our discussion of this interplay between entanglement and spontaneous symmetry breaking focuses on multicomponent quantum Hall systems realizing textured Wigner crystals, as may occur in graphene or possibly also in moir\'e systems, highlighting the rich landscape and properties of possible entanglement ordered phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover between regions differing in the momentum dependence of the coupling and not necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Empowering ChatGPT-Like Large-Scale Language Models with Local Knowledge Base for Industrial Prognostics and Health Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prognostics and health management (PHM) is essential for industrial operation and maintenance, focusing on predicting, diagnosing, and managing the health status of industrial systems. The emergence of the ChatGPT-Like large-scale language model (LLM) has begun to lead a new round of innovation in the AI field. It has extensively promoted the level of intelligence in various fields. Therefore, it is also expected further to change the application paradigm in industrial PHM and promote PHM to become intelligent. Although ChatGPT-Like LLMs have rich knowledge reserves and powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, they lack domain-specific expertise, significantly limiting their practicability in PHM applications. To this end, this study explores the ChatGPT-Like LLM empowered by the local knowledge base (LKB) in industrial PHM to solve the above limitations. In addition, we introduce the method and steps of combining the LKB with LLMs, including LKB preparation, LKB vectorization, prompt engineering, etc. Experimental analysis of real cases shows that combining the LKB with ChatGPT-Like LLM can significantly improve its performance and make ChatGPT-Like LLMs more accurate, relevant, and able to provide more insightful information. This can promote the development of ChatGPT-Like LLMs in industrial PHM and promote their efficiency and quality.</description>

      <title>Exotic synchronization in continuous time crystals outside the symmetric subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring continuous time crystals (CTCs) within the symmetric subspace of spin systems has been a subject of intensive research in recent times. Thus far, the stability of the time-crystal phase outside the symmetric subspace in such spin systems has gone largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect of including the asymmetric subspaces on the dynamics of CTCs in a driven dissipative spin model. This results in multistability, and the dynamics becomes dependent on the initial state. Remarkably, this multistability leads to exotic synchronization regimes such as chimera states and cluster synchronization in an ensemble of coupled identical CTCs. Interestingly, it leads to other nonlinear phenomena such as oscillation death and signature of chaos.</description>

Abstract: Energy materials with disorder in site occupation are challenging for computational studies due to an exponential scaling of the configuration space. We herein present a grand-canonical optimization method that enables the use of quantum annealing (QA) for sampling the ionic ground state. The method relies on a Legendre transformation of the Coulomb energy cost function that strongly reduces the effective coupling strengths of the fully connected problem, which is essential for effectiveness of QA. The approach is expected to be applicable to a variety of materials optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two important tasks in the field of Topological Data Analysis are building practical multifiltrations on objects and using TDA to detect the geometry. Motivated by the tasks, we build multiparameter filtrations by operators on images named multi-GENEO, multi-DGENEO and mix-GENEO, and we prove the stability of both the interleaving distance and multiparameter persistence landscape of multi-GENEO with respect to the pseudometric on bounded functions. We also give the estimations of upper bound for multi-DGENEO and mix-GENEO. In practical applications, we regard image as a discrete function space, and then we build multifiltrations on the discrete function space. Finally, we construct comparable experiment on MNIST dataset to demonstrate our bifiltrations are superior to 1-parameter filtrations including lower-star filtration and upper-star filtration. For instance, 6 and 9 can be distinguished by our bifiltrations, while they cannot be distinguished by 1-parameter filtrations. The experiment results demonstrate our bifiltrations have ability to detect geometric and topological differences of digital images.</description>

      <title>SOS-Match: Segmentation for Open-Set Robust Correspondence Search and Robot Localization in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SOS-Match, a novel framework for detecting and matching objects in unstructured environments. Our system consists of 1) a front-end mapping pipeline using a zero-shot segmentation model to extract object masks from images and track them across frames and 2) a frame alignment pipeline that uses the geometric consistency of object relationships to efficiently localize across a variety of conditions. We evaluate SOS-Match on the Batvik seasonal dataset which includes drone flights collected over a coastal plot of southern Finland during different seasons and lighting conditions. Results show that our approach is more robust to changes in lighting and appearance than classical image feature-based approaches or global descriptor methods, and it provides more viewpoint invariance than learning-based feature detection and description approaches. SOS-Match localizes within a reference map up to 46x faster than other feature-based approaches and has a map size less than 0.5% the size of the most compact other maps. SOS-Match is a promising new approach for landmark detection and correspondence search in unstructured environments that is robust to changes in lighting and appearance and is more computationally efficient than other approaches, suggesting that the geometric arrangement of segments is a valuable localization cue in unstructured environments. We release our datasets at https://acl.mit.edu/SOS-Match/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct operator models for meromorphic functions of bounded type on Krein spaces. This construction is based on certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces which are closely related to model spaces. Specifically, we show that each function of bounded type corresponds naturally to a pair of such spaces, extending Helson's representation theorem. This correspondence enables an explicit construction of our model, where the Krein space is a suitable sum of these identified spaces. Additionally, we establish that the representing self-adjoint relations possess a relatively simple structure, proving to be partially fundamentally reducible. Conversely, we show that realizations involving such relations correspond to functions of bounded type.</description>

Abstract: Consider a population of agents who repeatedly compete for awards, as in the case of researchers annually applying for grants. Noise in the selection process may encourage entry of low quality proposals, forcing the principal to commit large resources to reviewing applications and further increasing award misallocation. A \emph{temporary exclusion} policy prohibits an agent from applying in the current period if they were rejected in the previous. We compare the steady state equilibria of the games with and without exclusion. Whenever the benefit from winning is sufficiently large exclusion results in more self-selection, eliminating entry of low quality applications. We extend the analysis to more general exclusion policies. We also show that exclusion has a distributional effect, where better able agents exhibit more self-selection.</description>

Abstract: Molecular chirality has traditionally been viewed as a binary property where a molecule is classified as either chiral or achiral, yet in the recent decades mathematical methods for quantifying chirality have been explored. Here we use toy molecular systems to systematically compare the performance of two state of the art chirality measures (1) the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) and (2) the Chirality Characteristic ($\chi$). We find that both methods exhibit qualitatively similar behavior when applied to simple molecular systems such as a four-site molecule or the polymer double-helix, but we show that the CCM may be more suitable for evaluating the chirality of arbitrary molecules or abstract structures such as normal vibrational modes. We discuss a range of considerations for applying these methods to molecular systems in general, and we provide links to user-friendly codes for both methods. We aim this paper to serve as a concise resource for scientists attempting to familiarize themselves with these chirality measures or attempting to implement chirality measures in their own work.</description>

      <title>cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.
  To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.</description>

      <title>Radial perfectly matched layers and infinite elements for the anisotropic wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scalar anisotropic wave equation. Recently a convergence analysis for radial perfectly matched layers (PML) in the frequency domain was reported and in the present article we continue this approach into the time domain. First we explain why there is a good hope that radial complex scalings can overcome the instabilities of PML methods caused by anisotropic materials. Next we discuss some sensitive details, which seem like a paradox at the first glance: If the absorbing layer and the inhomogeneities are sufficiently separated, then the solution is indeed stable. However, for more general data the problem becomes unstable. In numerical computations we observe instabilities regardless of the position of the inhomogeneities, although the instabilities arise only for fine enough discretizations. As a remedy we propose a complex frequency shifted scaling and discretizations by Hardy space infinite elements or truncation-free PMLs. We show numerical experiments which confirm the stability and convergence of these methods.</description>

      <title>Discussions on the spatial exponential growth of electromagnetic quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temporal response of open systems is marked by damped oscillations. These oscillations, often referred to as ringings, are the signature of the decay of quasinormal modes (QNMs). A major research objective across various fields is to represent the response of open systems using QNM expansions, akin to the treatment of normal modes in closed systems. In electromagnetism, it is widely acknowledged that QNM expansions provide a relevant representation of the modal physics within the interior of compact resonators in free space, where QNMs form a complete set of the resonator. However, challenges emerge in the exterior of the resonator, where QNM fields exhibit exponential divergence, rendering QNM expansions incomplete. The divergence poses delicate mathematical issues that often lead to misinterpretations on the physics side. Hereafter, we analyze foundational concepts such as cavity perturbation theory and dissipative coupling between resonators. By studying model problems, we show that the exponential growth is physical and meaningful for understanding the interaction between remote electromagnetic bodies. The analysis consistently reveals that the coupling coefficients between QNMs of two distant bodies strengthen as the separation distance increases, therein challenging the intuition that distant bodies behave independently. These insights that shed light on the origin and implications of the divergence hold significant implications for understanding the ability of contemporary electromagnetic QNM theories in offering a modal representation of the physics in the open space surrounding resonator bodies. Our critical examination of these theories reveals the existence of two distinct perspectives and elucidates the significance of their contrasting viewpoints.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Post-API Dilemma | Search Engine Results Pages Present a Biased View of Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent decisions to discontinue access to social media APIs are having detrimental effects on Internet research and the field of computational social science as a whole. This lack of access to data has been dubbed the Post-API era of Internet research. Fortunately, popular search engines have the means to crawl, capture, and surface social media data on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) if provided the proper search query, and may provide a solution to this dilemma. In the present work we ask: does SERP provide a complete and unbiased sample of social media data? Is SERP a viable alternative to direct API-access? To answer these questions, we perform a comparative analysis between (Google) SERP results and nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X. We find that SERP results are highly biased in favor of popular posts; against political, pornographic, and vulgar posts; are more positive in their sentiment; and have large topical gaps. Overall, we conclude that SERP is not a viable alternative to social media API access.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact Riemann surface $X$, we consider the line, in the space of sections of $2\Theta$ on $J^0(X)$, orthogonal to all the sections that vanish at the origin. This line produces a natural meromorphic bidifferential on $X\times X$ with a pole of order two on the diagonal. This bidifferential is extensively investigated. In particular we show that it produces a projective structure on $X$ which is different from the standard ones.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation in this work is due to the great importance of relativistic boson stars as fierce competitors of black holes. From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar fields interacting with curved background in general form. In this work we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity in presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential to study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation of its stability. We choose the CW potential because of its important role in description of cosmic inflation.</description>

As examples, we consider the so-called self-similar $(s,1)$-staircase flows ($\Z$-extensions of self-similar translations flows of genus-$2$ surfaces), and particular cases of the Ehrenfest wind-tree model.</description>

Abstract: Living materials adapt their shape to signals from the environment, yet the impact of shape changes on signal processing and associated feedback dynamics remain unclear. We find that droplets with signal-responsive interfacial tensions exhibit shape bistability, excitable dynamics, and oscillations. The underlying critical points reveal novel mechanisms for physical signal processing through shape adaptation in soft active materials. We recover signatures of one such critical point in experimental data from zebrafish embryos, where it supports boundary formation.</description>

      <title>The pervasiveness of shape coexistence in nuclear pair condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear shape coexistence for a wide range of even-even nuclides. By varying general pair condensates, which include Slater determinants as a limit but also allow for arbitrary pairing channels, we frequently find multiple coexisting mimina, and often more than two. This is consistent with recent experimental results. In order to measure general pairwise correlations beyond a simple Slater determinant, we introduce a novel entropy-like measure, which is smallest mid-shell and largest near shell closures; this is consistent with a picture of pairing-like behavior dominating near closed shells and deformation mid-shell. After surveying nuclides spanning from the $sd$ shell to nuclides between magic numbers 50 and 82, we focus on the six lightest nuclei with shape coexistence. Angular-momentum projected variational pair condensate (PVPC) calculations identify band structures, including two newly proposed coexisting bands in $^{26}$Si/Mg and $^{24}$Si/Ne. The PVPC results agree well with data, providing robust experimental support for the pervasiveness of coexistence in these light nuclei.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturization of integrated circuits is facing an obstruction due to the escalating electrical resistivity of conventional copper interconnects. The underlying reason for this problem was unveiled by Fuchs and Sondheimer, who showed that thinner wires are more resistive because current-carrying electrons encounter the rough surfaces of the wire more frequently therein. Here, we present a generalization of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory to Dirac and Weyl materials, which are candidates for next-generation interconnects. We predict a nonlinear longitudinal electric current originating from the combined action of the Berry curvature and non-specular surface-scattering.</description>

      <title>MENTOR: Guiding Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback and Dynamic Distance Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) provides a promising solution for complex tasks with sparse rewards of intelligent agents, which uses a hierarchical framework that divides tasks into subgoals and completes them sequentially. However, current methods struggle to find suitable subgoals for ensuring a stable learning process. Without additional guidance, it is impractical to rely solely on exploration or heuristics methods to determine subgoals in a large goal space. To address the issue, We propose a general hierarchical reinforcement learning framework incorporating human feedback and dynamic distance constraints (MENTOR). MENTOR acts as a "mentor", incorporating human feedback into high-level policy learning, to find better subgoals. As for low-level policy, MENTOR designs a dual policy for exploration-exploitation decoupling respectively to stabilize the training. Furthermore, although humans can simply break down tasks into subgoals to guide the right learning direction, subgoals that are too difficult or too easy can still hinder downstream learning efficiency. We propose the Dynamic Distance Constraint (DDC) mechanism dynamically adjusting the space of optional subgoals. Thus MENTOR can generate subgoals matching the low-level policy learning process from easy to hard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR uses a small amount of human feedback to achieve significant improvement in complex tasks with sparse rewards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to the economy. While Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fraud detection methods perform well, they often overlook the causal effect of a node's local structure on predictions. This paper introduces a novel method for credit card fraud detection, the \textbf{\underline{Ca}}usal \textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{G}}raph \textbf{\underline{N}}eural \textbf{N}etwork (CaT-GNN), which leverages causal invariant learning to reveal inherent correlations within transaction data. By decomposing the problem into discovery and intervention phases, CaT-GNN identifies causal nodes within the transaction graph and applies a causal mixup strategy to enhance the model's robustness and interpretability. CaT-GNN consists of two key components: Causal-Inspector and Causal-Intervener. The Causal-Inspector utilizes attention weights in the temporal attention mechanism to identify causal and environment nodes without introducing additional parameters. Subsequently, the Causal-Intervener performs a causal mixup enhancement on environment nodes based on the set of nodes. Evaluated on three datasets, including a private financial dataset and two public datasets, CaT-GNN demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating causal reasoning with graph neural networks to improve fraud detection capabilities in financial transactions.</description>

      <title>A First Look at GPT Apps: Landscape and Vulnerability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of GPTs, a surge in GPT apps has led to the launch of dedicated LLM app stores. Nevertheless, given its debut, there is a lack of sufficient understanding of this new ecosystem. To fill this gap, this paper presents a first comprehensive longitudinal (5-month) study of the evolution, landscape, and vulnerability of the emerging LLM app ecosystem, focusing on two GPT app stores: \textit{GPTStore.AI} and the official \textit{OpenAI GPT Store}. Specifically, we develop two automated tools and a TriLevel configuration extraction strategy to efficiently gather metadata (\ie names, creators, descriptions, \etc) and user feedback for all GPT apps across these two stores, as well as configurations (\ie system prompts, knowledge files, and APIs) for the top 10,000 popular apps. Our extensive analysis reveals: (1) the user enthusiasm for GPT apps consistently rises, whereas creator interest plateaus within three months of GPTs' launch; (2) nearly 90\% system prompts can be easily accessed due to widespread failure to secure GPT app configurations, leading to considerable plagiarism and duplication among apps. Our findings highlight the necessity of enhancing the LLM app ecosystem by the app stores, creators, and users.</description>

      <title>Revelation of new magnetic domain wall category and spin-density-wave boundary state in itinerant magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are typically characterized by the reorientation of local moments. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic boundaries of spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we observed that the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation, which generated a double-Q SDW state accompanied by a second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. The screw dislocations induced "half" vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. We find the spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls; while for the first time, we observed intriguing SDW in-gap states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new category of magnetic domain wall - the "interference wall", with a mechanism rooted in itinerant nature of the system.</description>

      <title>On recurrence for $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Weyl systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological recurrence phenomenon of actions of locally compact abelian groups on compact metric spaces. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions we develop new techniques to analyze Bohr recurrence sets. These techniques include finding and manipulating correlations between the coordinates of the set of recurrence. Using this, we show that Bohr recurrence sets are recurrence sets for $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Weyl systems. This family encompasses, for example, all $\mathbb{Z}^d$-affine nilsystems. To our knowledge, this is the first result towards a positive answer to Katznelson question in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Mergers in AGN Discs: Influence of the Supermassive Black-Hole on Three-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are indications that stellar-origin black holes (BHs) are efficiently paired up in binary black holes (BBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disc environments, which can undergo interactions with single BHs in the disc. Such binary-single interactions can potentially lead to an exceptionally high fraction of gravitational-wave mergers with measurable eccentricity in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. We here take the next important step in this line of studies, by performing post-Newtonian N-body simulations between migrating BBHs and single BHs set in an AGN disc-like configuration with a consistent inclusion of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the equations of motion. With this setup, we study how the fraction of eccentric mergers varies in terms of the initial size of the BBH semi-major axis relative to the Hill sphere, as well as how it depends on the angle between the BBH and the incoming single BH. We find that the fraction of eccentric mergers is still relatively large, even when the interactions are notably influenced by the gravitational field of the nearby SMBH. However, the fraction as a function of the BBH semi-major axis does not follow a smooth functional shape, but instead shows strongly varying features that originate from the underlying phase-space structure. The phase-space further reveals that many of the eccentric mergers are formed through prompt scatterings. Finally, we present the first analytical solution to how the presence of an SMBH in terms of its Hill sphere affects the probability for forming eccentric BBH mergers through chaotic three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Rewriting techniques for relative coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of works has established rewriting as an essential tool in order to prove coherence properties of algebraic structures, such as MacLane's coherence theorem for monoidal categories, based on the observation that, under reasonable assumptions, confluence diagrams for critical pairs provide the required coherence axioms. We are interested here in extending this approach simultaneously in two directions. Firstly, we want to take into account situations where coherence is partial, in the sense that it only applies to a subset of the structural morphisms. Secondly, we are interested in structures which are cartesian in the sense that variables can be duplicated or erased. We develop theorems and rewriting techniques in order to achieve this, first in the setting of abstract rewriting systems, and then extend them to term rewriting systems, suitably generalized to take coherence into account. As an illustration of our results, we explain how to recover the coherence theorems for monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules provide a method to obtain trans-series expansions in many quantum field theories, in which exponentially small corrections are calculated by combining the operator product expansion with the assumption of vacuum condensates. In some solvable models, exact expressions for trans-series can be obtained from non-perturbative results, and this makes it possible to test the SVZ method by comparing its predictions to these exact trans-series. In this paper we perform such a precision test in the example of the fermion self-energy in the Gross-Neveu model. Its exact trans-series expansion can be extracted from the large $N$ solution, at the first non-trivial order in $1/N$. It is given by an infinite series of exponentially small corrections involving factorially divergent power series in the 't Hooft parameter. We show that the first two corrections are associated to two-quark and four-quark condensates, and we reproduce the corresponding power series exactly, and at all loops, by using the SVZ method. In addition, the numerical values of the condensates can be extracted from the exact result, up to order $1/N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and the slow, classical part of the correlations, but fails to describe the rapidly propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the many-body background.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Time-Varying Origin-Destination Matrices from Boarding/Alighting Counts for Transit Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origin-destination (OD) demand matrices are crucial for transit agencies to design and operate transit systems. This paper presents a novel temporal Bayesian model designed to estimate transit OD matrices at the individual bus-journey level from boarding/alighting counts at bus stops. Our approach begins by modeling the number of alighting passengers at subsequent bus stops, given a boarding stop, through a multinomial distribution parameterized by alighting probabilities. Given the large scale of the problem, we generate alighting probabilities with a latent variable matrix and factorize it into a mapping matrix and a temporal matrix, thereby substantially reducing the number of parameters. To further encode a temporally-smooth structure in the parameters, we impose a Gaussian process prior on the columns of the temporal factor matrix. For model inference, we develop a two-stage algorithm with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. In the first stage, latent OD matrices are sampled conditional on model parameters using a Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm with a Markov model-based proposal distribution. In the second stage, we sample model parameters conditional on latent OD matrices using slice and elliptical slice sampling algorithms. We assess the proposed model using real-world data collected from three bus routes with varying numbers of stops, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves accurate posterior mean estimation and outperforms the widely used iterative proportional fitting (IPF) method. Additionally, our model can provide uncertainty quantification for the OD demand matrices, thus benefiting many downstream planning/operational tasks that require robust decisions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Intraday Electricity Prices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the need for forecasting methodologies that handle large uncertainties in electricity prices for continuous intraday markets by incorporating parameter uncertainty and using a broad set of covariables. This study presents the first Bayesian forecasting of electricity prices traded on the German intraday market. Endogenous and exogenous covariables are handled via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and regularising priors. The target variable is the IDFull price index, with forecasts given as posterior predictive distributions. Validation uses the highly volatile 2022 electricity prices, which have seldom been studied. As a benchmark, we use all intraday transactions at the time of forecast to compute a live IDFull value. According to market efficiency, it should not be possible to improve on this last-price benchmark. However, we observe significant improvements in point measures and probability scores, including an average reduction of $5.9\,\%$ in absolute errors and an average increase of $1.7\,\%$ in accuracy when forecasting whether the IDFull exceeds the day-ahead price. Finally, we challenge the use of LASSO in electricity price forecasting, showing that OMP results in superior performance, specifically an average reduction of $22.7\,\%$ in absolute error and $20.2\,\%$ in the continuous ranked probability score.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphologies Revealed with Subaru HSC and Super-Resolution Techniques II: Environmental Dependence of Galaxy Mergers at z~2-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We super-resolve the seeing-limited Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images for 32,187 galaxies at z~2-5 in three techniques, namely, the classical Richardson-Lucy (RL) point spread function (PSF) deconvolution, sparse modeling, and generative adversarial networks to investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers. These three techniques generate overall similar high spatial resolution images but with some slight differences in galaxy structures, for example, more residual noises are seen in the classical RL PSF deconvolution. To alleviate disadvantages of each technique, we create combined images by averaging over the three types of super-resolution images, which result in galaxy sub-structures resembling those seen in the Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the combined super-resolution images, we measure the relative galaxy major merger fraction corrected for the chance projection effect, f_merg, for galaxies in the ~300 deg^2-area data of the HSC Strategic Survey Program and the CFHT Large Area U-band Survey. Our f_merg measurements at z~3 validate previous findings showing that f_merg is higher in regions with a higher galaxy overdensity delta at z~2-3. Thanks to the large galaxy sample, we identify a nearly linear increase in f_merg with increasing delta at z~4-5, providing the highest-z observational evidence that galaxy mergers are related to delta. In addition to our f_merg measurements, we find that the galaxy merger fractions in the literature also broadly align with the linear f_merg-delta relation across a wide redshift range of z~2-5. This alignment suggests that the linear f_merg-delta relation can serve as a valuable tool for quantitatively estimating the contributions of galaxy mergers to various environmental dependences. This super-resolution analysis can be readily applied to datasets from wide field-of-view space telescopes such as Euclid and Roman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter reports a search for charge-parity ($CP$) symmetry violating nonstandard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter using the NOvA Experiment, and examines their effects on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters. Data from $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ and $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ oscillation channels are used to measure the effect of the NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$. With 90% CL the magnitudes of the NSI couplings are constrained to be $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \, \lesssim 0.3$ and $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \lesssim 0.4$. A degeneracy at $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \approx 1.8$ is reported, and we observe that the presence of NSI limits sensitivity to the standard $CP$ phase $\delta_{\tiny\text{CP}}$.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in diverse applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As the scale of modern datasets increases, there is a growing need for statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle many observations. This article introduces the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model that infers rich spatiotemporal probability distributions for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust predictive uncertainty quantification. Evaluations against prominent baselines show that BayesNF delivers improvements on prediction problems from climate and public health data containing tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. Accompanying the paper is an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that runs on GPU and TPU accelerators through the JAX machine learning platform.</description>

      <title>Concepts and methods for predicting viral evolution</title>

Abstract: The seasonal human influenza virus undergoes rapid evolution, leading to significant changes in circulating viral strains from year to year. These changes are typically driven by adaptive mutations, particularly in the antigenic epitopes, the regions of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin targeted by human antibodies. Here we describe a consistent set of methods for data-driven predictive analysis of viral evolution. Our pipeline integrates four types of data: (1) sequence data of viral isolates collected on a worldwide scale, (2) epidemiological data on incidences, (3) antigenic characterization of circulating viruses, and (4) intrinsic viral phenotypes. From the combined analysis of these data, we obtain estimates of relative fitness for circulating strains and predictions of clade frequencies for periods of up to one year. Furthermore, we obtain comparative estimates of protection against future viral populations for candidate vaccine strains, providing a basis for pre-emptive vaccine strain selection. Continuously updated predictions obtained from the prediction pipeline for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are available on the website https://previr.app.</description>

      <title>When is Trust Robust?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine an economy in which interactions are more productive if agents can trust others to refrain from cheating. Some agents are scoundrels, who cheat at every opportunity, while others cheat only if the cost of cheating, a decreasing function of the proportion of cheaters, is sufficiently low. The economy exhibits multiple equilibria. As the proportion of scoundrels in the economy declines, the high-trust equilibrium can be disrupted by arbitrarily small perturbations or by arbitrarily small infusions of low-trust agents, while the low-trust equilibrium becomes impervious to perturbations and infusions of high-trust agents. Scoundrels may thus have the effect of making trust more robust.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations with Basset history term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations (MRGE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRGE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath et al. exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRGE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva et al. and Fazio et al. to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRGE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche. While all methods achieve their theoretical convergence order for neutrally buoyant particles with zero initial relative velocity, they suffer from various degrees of order reduction if the initial relative velocity is non-zero or the particle has a different density than the fluid.</description>

      <title>Learning and communication pressures in neural networks: Lessons from emergent communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding and facilitating commonalities between the linguistic behaviors of large language models and humans could lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of the acquisition, processing, and evolution of language. However, most findings on human-LLM similarity can be attributed to training on human data. The field of emergent machine-to-machine communication provides an ideal testbed for discovering which pressures are neural agents naturally exposed to when learning to communicate in isolation, without any human language to start with. Here, we review three cases where mismatches between the emergent linguistic behavior of neural agents and humans were resolved thanks to introducing theoretically-motivated inductive biases. By contrasting humans, large language models, and emergent communication agents, we then identify key pressures at play for language learning and emergence: communicative success, production effort, learnability, and other psycho-/sociolinguistic factors. We discuss their implications and relevance to the field of language evolution and acquisition. By mapping out the necessary inductive biases that make agents' emergent languages more human-like, we not only shed light on the underlying principles of human cognition and communication, but also inform and improve the very use of these models as valuable scientific tools for studying language learning, processing, use, and representation more broadly.</description>

      <title>Learning to Project for Cross-Task Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) relies on a proficient teacher trained on the target task, which is not always available. In this setting, cross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model trained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when applied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a simple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this drop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to disregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's performance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending many KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks can be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the cross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional cost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%) when using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth estimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of any learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical insights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the distillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral regularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able to propose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation, enabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additional training costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tunneling Spectroscopy in Unconventional $p$-wave Magnet-Superconductor Hybrid Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional unconventional $p$-wave magnet (UPM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing symmetries. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are insensitive against varying the magnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic change as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a UPM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing symmetries of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of UPM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>

Abstract: We consider a matrix nonlinear partial differential equation that generalizes Heisenberg ferromagnet equation. This generalized Heisenberg ferromagnet equation is completely integrable with a linear bundle Lax pair related to the pseudo-unitary algebra. This allows us to explicitly derive particular solutions by using dressing technique. We shall discuss two classes of solutions over constant background: soliton-like solutions and quasi-rational solutions. Both classes have their analogues in the case of the Heisenberg ferromagnet equation related to the same Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today due to the presence of experimental uncertainties. In fact, a purely kinematical triangle diagram is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements with a reasonably high accuracy of discrimination between the two seemingly identical line shapes. We also identify the type of triangle enhancement that can be misidentified as a dynamic pole structure. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a triangle singularity, but is more consistent with a pole-based interpretation, as determined solely through pure line-shape analysis. Lastly, we explain how our method can be used as a model-selection framework useful in studying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI has revolutionised visual content editing, empowering users to effortlessly modify images and videos. However, not all edits are equal. To perform realistic edits in domains such as natural image or medical imaging, modifications must respect causal relationships inherent to the data generation process. Such image editing falls into the counterfactual image generation regime. Evaluating counterfactual image generation is substantially complex: not only it lacks observable ground truths, but also requires adherence to causal constraints. Although several counterfactual image generation methods and evaluation metrics exist, a comprehensive comparison within a unified setting is lacking. We present a comparison framework to thoroughly benchmark counterfactual image generation methods. We integrate all models that have been used for the task at hand and expand them to novel datasets and causal graphs, demonstrating the superiority of Hierarchical VAEs across most datasets and metrics. Our framework is implemented in a user-friendly Python package that can be extended to incorporate additional SCMs, causal methods, generative models, and datasets for the community to build on.

      <description>arXiv:2404.00345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of 3D scenes from user-specified conditions offers a promising avenue for alleviating the production burden in 3D applications. Previous studies required significant effort to realize the desired scene, owing to limited control conditions. We propose a method for controlling and generating 3D scenes under multimodal conditions using partial images, layout information represented in the top view, and text prompts. Combining these conditions to generate a 3D scene involves the following significant difficulties: (1) the creation of large datasets, (2) reflection on the interaction of multimodal conditions, and (3) domain dependence of the layout conditions. We decompose the process of 3D scene generation into 2D image generation from the given conditions and 3D scene generation from 2D images. 2D image generation is achieved by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-image model with a small artificial dataset of partial images and layouts, and 3D scene generation is achieved by layout-conditioned depth estimation and neural radiance fields (NeRF), thereby avoiding the creation of large datasets. The use of a common representation of spatial information using 360-degree images allows for the consideration of multimodal condition interactions and reduces the domain dependence of the layout control. The experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated that the proposed method can generate 3D scenes in diverse domains, from indoor to outdoor, according to multimodal conditions.</description>

Abstract: The rise of algorithmic pricing raises concerns of algorithmic collusion. We conduct experiments with algorithmic pricing agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that (1) LLM-based agents are adept at pricing tasks, (2) LLM-based pricing agents autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers, and (3) variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions ("prompts") may increase collusion. Novel off-path analysis techniques uncover price-war concerns as contributing to these phenomena. Our results extend to auction settings. Our findings uncover unique challenges to any future regulation of LLM-based pricing agents, and black-box pricing agents more broadly.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

Abstract: Regression on function spaces is typically limited to models with Gaussian process priors. We introduce the notion of universal functional regression, in which we aim to learn a prior distribution over non-Gaussian function spaces that remains mathematically tractable for functional regression. To do this, we develop Neural Operator Flows (OpFlow), an infinite-dimensional extension of normalizing flows. OpFlow is an invertible operator that maps the (potentially unknown) data function space into a Gaussian process, allowing for exact likelihood estimation of functional point evaluations. OpFlow enables robust and accurate uncertainty quantification via drawing posterior samples of the Gaussian process and subsequently mapping them into the data function space. We empirically study the performance of OpFlow on regression and generation tasks with data generated from Gaussian processes with known posterior forms and non-Gaussian processes, as well as real-world earthquake seismograms with an unknown closed-form distribution.</description>

      <title>Searches for pair-produced multijet resonances using data scouting in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for pair-produced multijet signatures using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 128 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are presented. A data scouting technique is employed to record events with low jet scalar transverse momentum sum values. The electroweak production of particles predicted in $R$-parity violating supersymmetric models is probed for the first time with fully hadronic final states. This is the first search for prompt hadronically decaying mass-degenerate higgsinos, and extends current exclusions on $R$-parity violating top squarks and gluinos.</description>

      <title>DPFT: Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer for Camera-Radar-based Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perception of autonomous vehicles has to be efficient, robust, and cost-effective. However, cameras are not robust against severe weather conditions, lidar sensors are expensive, and the performance of radar-based perception is still inferior to the others. Camera-radar fusion methods have been proposed to address this issue, but these are constrained by the typical sparsity of radar point clouds and often designed for radars without elevation information. We propose a novel camera-radar fusion approach called Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer (DPFT), designed to overcome these limitations. Our method leverages lower-level radar data (the radar cube) instead of the processed point clouds to preserve as much information as possible and employs projections in both the camera and ground planes to effectively use radars with elevation information and simplify the fusion with camera data. As a result, DPFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar dataset while showing remarkable robustness against adverse weather conditions and maintaining a low inference time. The code is made available as open-source software under https://github.com/TUMFTM/DPFT.</description>

      <title>CoMat: Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Image-to-Text Concept Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in the field of text-to-image generation. However, alleviating the misalignment between the text prompts and images is still challenging. The root reason behind the misalignment has not been extensively investigated. We observe that the misalignment is caused by inadequate token attention activation. We further attribute this phenomenon to the diffusion model's insufficient condition utilization, which is caused by its training paradigm. To address the issue, we propose CoMat, an end-to-end diffusion model fine-tuning strategy with an image-to-text concept matching mechanism. We leverage an image captioning model to measure image-to-text alignment and guide the diffusion model to revisit ignored tokens. A novel attribute concentration module is also proposed to address the attribute binding problem. Without any image or human preference data, we use only 20K text prompts to fine-tune SDXL to obtain CoMat-SDXL. Extensive experiments show that CoMat-SDXL significantly outperforms the baseline model SDXL in two text-to-image alignment benchmarks and achieves start-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>JADES: Primaeval Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies reveal early sites of reionisation out to redshift $z \sim 9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ (Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at $z&gt;8$, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright ($M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}$) LAEs exhibit small Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, $\Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, yet span a range of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ equivalent widths ($15\,\AA$, $31\,\AA$, and $132\,\AA$). The former two show moderate Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10\%$), whereas Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escapes remarkably efficiently from the third ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72\%$), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of $90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}$). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest $f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}$, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$. The third, however, requires a $\sim 3\,\text{physical Mpc}$ bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.</description>

      <title>Data Readiness for AI: A 360-Degree Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications critically depend on data. Poor quality data produces inaccurate and ineffective AI models that may lead to incorrect or unsafe use. Evaluation of data readiness is a crucial step in improving the quality and appropriateness of data usage for AI. R&amp;D efforts have been spent on improving data quality. However, standardized metrics for evaluating data readiness for use in AI training are still evolving. In this study, we perform a comprehensive survey of metrics used to verify data readiness for AI training. This survey examines more than 140 papers published by ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, journals such as Nature, Springer, and Science Direct, and online articles published by prominent AI experts. This survey aims to propose a taxonomy of data readiness for AI (DRAI) metrics for structured and unstructured datasets. We anticipate that this taxonomy will lead to new standards for DRAI metrics that will be used for enhancing the quality, accuracy, and fairness of AI training and inference.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (35\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>

      <title>Galois Self-dual 2-quasi Constacyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field with cardinality $p^\ell$ and $0\neq \lambda\in F$, and $0\le h&lt;\ell$. Extending Euclidean and Hermitian inner products, Fan and Zhang introduced Galois $p^h$-inner product (DCC, vol.84, pp.473-492). In this paper, we characterize the structure of $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes over $F$; and exhibit necessary and sufficient conditions for $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes being Galois self-dual. With the help of a technique developed in this paper, we prove that, when $\ell$ is even, the Hermitian self-dual $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes are asymptotically good if and only if $\lambda^{1+p^{\ell/2}}=1$. And, when $p^\ell\,{\not\equiv}\,3~({\rm mod}~4)$, the Euclidean self-dual $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes are asymptotically good if and only if $\lambda^{2}=1$.</description>

      <title>EFSA: Towards Event-Level Financial Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend financial sentiment analysis~(FSA) to event-level since events usually serve as the subject of the sentiment in financial text. Though extracting events from the financial text may be conducive to accurate sentiment predictions, it has specialized challenges due to the lengthy and discontinuity of events in a financial text. To this end, we reconceptualize the event extraction as a classification task by designing a categorization comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained event categories. Under this setting, we formulate the \textbf{E}vent-Level \textbf{F}inancial \textbf{S}entiment \textbf{A}nalysis~(\textbf{EFSA} for short) task that outputs quintuples consisting of (company, industry, coarse-grained event, fine-grained event, sentiment) from financial text. A large-scale Chinese dataset containing $12,160$ news articles and $13,725$ quintuples is publicized as a brand new testbed for our task. A four-hop Chain-of-Thought LLM-based approach is devised for this task. Systematically investigations are conducted on our dataset, and the empirical results demonstrate the benchmarking scores of existing methods and our proposed method can reach the current state-of-the-art. Our dataset and framework implementation are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EFSA-645E</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an essential task in the analysis of dynamic networks, offering early warnings of abnormal behavior. We present a principled approach to detect anomalies in dynamic networks that integrates community structure as a foundational model for regular behavior. Our model identifies anomalies as irregular edges while capturing structural changes. Our approach leverages a Markovian framework for temporal transitions and latent variables for community and anomaly detection, inferring hidden parameters to detect unusual interactions. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show strong anomaly detection across various scenarios. In a case study on professional football player transfers, we detect patterns influenced by club wealth and country, as well as unexpected transactions both within and across community boundaries. This work provides a framework for adaptable anomaly detection, highlighting the value of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven techniques for improved interpretability and robustness in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art performance in QA tasks is currently achieved by systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs), however these models tend to hallucinate information in their responses. One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output. However, the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems. We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions. This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output. Evaluations on two context-enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions. In addition, the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs, showing their potential to outperform GPT-4 in some cases.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental construction of Poisson algebras is to derive them as the quasiclassical limits (QCLs) of associative algebra deformations of commutative associative algebras. This paper lifts this process to the level of classical Yang-Baxter type equations. Solutions of the Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (PYBE) in Poisson algebras is obtained by scalarly deforming solutions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation (AYBE) in commutative associative algebras. Inspired by the characterization of solutions of various classical Yang-Baxter type equations by $\mathcal{O}$-operators, we introduce the notions of deformations of (bi)module algebras and scalar deformations of the corresponding $\mathcal{O}$-operators, from which the QCLs give $\mathcal{O}$-operators for Poisson algebras, which in turn provide solutions of the PYBE. Furthermore, as the QCLs of tridendriform algebra deformations of commutative tridendriform algebras, post-Poisson algebras produce deformations-QCLs of $\mathcal{O}$-operators for Poisson algebras, thus offering explicit solutions of the PYBE.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance: Interception and Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic security is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, due to one of two reasons: Interception or loss. We consider two corresponding models. In the first model, Eve may intercept the entanglement resource. In the second model, Eve is passive, and the resource may dissipate to the environment beyond her reach. We derive achievable rates for both models, subject to a maximal error criterion and semantic security. As an example, we consider the amplitude damping channel. Under interception, time division is not necessarily possible, and the boundary of our achievable region is disconnected. In the passive model, our rate region outperforms time division.</description>

      <title>Time-aware Heterogeneous Graph Transformer with Adaptive Attention Merging for Health Event Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread application of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data in the medical field has led to early successes in disease risk prediction using deep learning methods. These methods typically require extensive data for training due to their large parameter sets. However, existing works do not exploit the full potential of EHR data. A significant challenge arises from the infrequent occurrence of many medical codes within EHR data, limiting their clinical applicability. Current research often lacks in critical areas: 1) incorporating disease domain knowledge; 2) heterogeneously learning disease representations with rich meanings; 3) capturing the temporal dynamics of disease progression. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel heterogeneous graph learning model designed to assimilate disease domain knowledge and elucidate the intricate relationships between drugs and diseases. This model innovatively incorporates temporal data into visit-level embeddings and leverages a time-aware transformer alongside an adaptive attention mechanism to produce patient representations. When evaluated on two healthcare datasets, our approach demonstrated notable enhancements in both prediction accuracy and interpretability over existing methodologies, signifying a substantial advancement towards personalized and proactive healthcare management.</description>

      <title>Age-minimal Multicast by Graph Attention Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating the timeliness of information in time-critical applications. Applications, including video streaming, virtual reality, and metaverse platforms, necessitate the use of multicast communication. Optimizing AoI in multicast networks is challenging due to the coupled multicast routing and scheduling decisions, the network dynamics, and the complexity of the multicast. This paper focuses on dynamic multicast networks and aims to minimize the expected average AoI through the integration of multicast routing and scheduling. To address the inherent complexity of the problem, we first propose to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the heuristics of multicast routing, based on which we decompose the original problem into two subtasks that are amenable to hierarchical RL methods. Subsequently, we propose an innovative framework based on graph attention networks (GATs) and prove its contraction mapping property. Such a GAT framework effectively captures graph information used in the hierarchical RL framework with superior generalization capabilities. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments on three datasets, including a real-world dataset called AS-733, and show that our proposed scheme reduces the average weighted AoI by $38.2\%$ and the weighted peak age by $43.4\%$ compared to baselines over all datasets in dynamic networks.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Impact of Brane-Chern-Simons Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel extension of massive gravity theory; the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory. We explore the cosmological implications of this theory by deriving the background equations and demonstrating the existence of self-accelerating solutions. Interestingly, our theory suggests the existence of self-accelerating mechanisms that originate from an effective cosmological constant, leading to intriguing possibilities for understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we perform a tensor perturbation analysis to investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in this framework. We derive the dispersion relation for gravitational waves and study their behavior in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Waker cosmology within the context of Brane-Chen-Simons massive gravity. Utilizing the latest Union2 type Ia supernova dataset comprising $557$ SNIa events, we provide observational support for our theoretical framework, indicating that the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory is consistent with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Neural network prediction of model parameters for strong lensing samples from Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong lensing of background galaxies provides important information about the matter distribution around lens galaxies. Traditional modelling of such strong lenses is both time and resource intensive. Fast and automated analysis methods are the need of the hour given large upcoming surveys. In this work, we build and train a simple convolutional neural network with an aim of rapidly predicting model parameters of gravitational lenses. We focus on the inference of the Einstein radius, and ellipticity components of the mass distribution. We train our network on a variety of simulated data with increasing degree of realism and compare its performance on simulated test data in a quantitative manner. We also model 182 gravitational lenses from Subaru HSC survey using {\sc YattaLens} pipeline to infer their model parameters, which allow a benchmark to compare the predictions of the network. Given all considerations, we conclude that the network trained on simulated samples with lensed sources injected in empty HSC cutouts is the most robust, reproducing Einstein radii with an accuracy of about $10-20$ percent, a bias less than 5 percent, and an outlier fraction of the order of 10 percent. We argue in favour of the subtraction of the lens light before modelling the lens mass distribution. Our comparisons of the inferred parameters of 10 HSC lenses previously modelled in the literature, demonstrate agreement on the Einstein radius. However, the ellipticity components from the network as well as the individual modelling methods, seem to have systematic uncertainties beyond the quoted errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite many reports of valley-related phenomena in graphene and its multilayers, current transport experiments cannot probe valley phenomena without the application of external fields. Here we propose a gate-defined valley splitter as a direct transport probe for valley phenomenon in graphene multilayers. First, we show how the device works, its magnetotransport response, and its robustness against fabrication errors. Secondly, we present two applications for valley splitters: (i) resonant tunneling of quantum dots probed by a valley splitter shows the valley polarization of dot levels; (ii) a combination of two valley splitters resolves the nature of order parameters in mesoscopic samples.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models in Human-Robot Interaction: A Critical Analysis of Potential and Pitfalls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLM) and, consequently, vision language models (VLM) has ignited new imaginations among robotics researchers. At this point, the range of applications to which LLM and VLM can be applied in human-robot interaction (HRI), particularly socially assistive robots (SARs), is unchartered territory. However, LLM and VLM present unprecedented opportunities and challenges for SAR integration. We aim to illuminate the opportunities and challenges when roboticists deploy LLM and VLM in SARs. First, we conducted a meta-study of more than 250 papers exploring 1) major robots in HRI research and 2) significant applications of SARs, emphasizing education, healthcare, and entertainment while addressing 3) societal norms and issues like trust, bias, and ethics that the robot developers must address. Then, we identified 4) critical components of a robot that LLM or VLM can replace while addressing the 5) benefits of integrating LLM into robot designs and the 6) risks involved. Finally, we outline a pathway for the responsible and effective adoption of LLM or VLM into SARs, and we close our discussion by offering caution regarding this deployment.</description>

      <title>Segmentation-Free Outcome Prediction from Head and Neck Cancer PET/CT Images: Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction from Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MA-MIPs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative, simple, effective segmentation-free approach for outcome prediction in head \&amp; neck cancer (HNC) patients. By harnessing deep learning-based feature extraction techniques and multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) applied to Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) volumes, our proposed method eliminates the need for manual segmentations of regions-of-interest (ROIs) such as primary tumors and involved lymph nodes. Instead, a state-of-the-art object detection model is trained to perform automatic cropping of the head and neck region on the PET volumes. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network backbone is then utilized to extract deep features from MA-MIPs obtained from 72 multi-angel axial rotations of the cropped PET volumes. These deep features extracted from multiple projection views of the PET volumes are then aggregated and fused, and employed to perform recurrence-free survival analysis on a cohort of 489 HNC patients. The proposed approach outperforms the best performing method on the target dataset for the task of recurrence-free survival analysis. By circumventing the manual delineation of the malignancies on the FDG PET-CT images, our approach eliminates the dependency on subjective interpretations and highly enhances the reproducibility of the proposed survival analysis method.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we successfully identify a cosmological sector for General Relativity in Ashtekar variables, which preserves the SU(2) gauge structure of the theory. As a consequence, we proceed to quantize it using the machinery of Loop Quantum Gravity, uncovering that the resulting Hilbert space is generated by spin-network states that exhibit distinctive symmetry properties and encompass the usual states of Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos with Diverse Baryonic Distributions: A Parametric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies residing in dark matter halos exert significant gravitational effects that alter halo structure and dynamics. The complexity of these interactions escalates with the diversity of galactic structures and the variability in dark matter halo profiles under self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models. This work extends the parametric model for dark matter-only halos presented in arXiv:2305.16176 to incorporate baryons. We adapt this model to consistently represent the SIDM halo density profile over time, highlighting the role of a gravothermal phase in characterizing the state of an SIDM halo. Given this phase, the density profile in SIDM is determined by a fictitious progenitor -- consisting of an NFW halo influenced by a baryonic potential -- that has evolved to its present state. In the temporal dimension, the model incorporates a form factor that rescales the evolution time in the dark matter-only case, thereby enabling the introduction of a universal phase. In the radial dimension, the halo density profile is parametrized to reflect the influences of baryons. We calibrate the model through N-body simulations with baryon potentials to fit various stellar-to-halo mass ratios and size-mass relationships. Our parametric approach is numerically efficient, enabling the exploration of SIDM effects across a diverse set of halos, as exemplified by a case study using an illustrative sample that spans five orders of magnitude in the mass range. We also demonstrate that the effects of evolution history and the specific SIDM model can be separated from the current states of galaxies and halos, leaving the task of identifying consistent SIDM models to dedicated post-processing analyses.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the optimization process of Physics Informed Neural Networks: How accurate and competitive can PINNs be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Selective Classification Under Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In selective classification (SC), a classifier abstains from making predictions that are likely to be wrong to avoid excessive errors. To deploy imperfect classifiers -- either due to intrinsic statistical noise of data or for robustness issue of the classifier or beyond -- in high-stakes scenarios, SC appears to be an attractive and necessary path to follow. Despite decades of research in SC, most previous SC methods still focus on the ideal statistical setting only, i.e., the data distribution at deployment is the same as that of training, although practical data can come from the wild. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an SC framework that takes into account distribution shifts, termed generalized selective classification, that covers label-shifted (or out-of-distribution) and covariate-shifted samples, in addition to typical in-distribution samples, the first of its kind in the SC literature. We focus on non-training-based confidence-score functions for generalized SC on deep learning (DL) classifiers, and propose two novel margin-based score functions. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we show that our proposed score functions are more effective and reliable than the existing ones for generalized SC on a variety of classification tasks and DL classifiers.

      <title>Performance Prediction of On-NIC Network Functions with Multi-Resource Contention and Traffic Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network function (NF) offloading on SmartNICs has been widely used in modern data centers, offering benefits in host resource saving and programmability. Co-running NFs on the same SmartNICs can cause performance interference due to contention of onboard resources. To meet performance SLAs while ensuring efficient resource management, operators need mechanisms to predict NF performance under such contention. However, existing solutions lack SmartNIC-specific knowledge and exhibit limited traffic awareness, leading to poor accuracy for on-NIC NFs. This paper proposes Yala, a novel performance predictive system for on-NIC NFs. Yala builds upon the key observation that co-located NFs contend for multiple resources, including onboard accelerators and the memory subsystem. It also facilitates traffic awareness according to the behaviors of individual resources to maintain accuracy as the external traffic attributes vary. Evaluation using BlueField-2 SmartNICs shows that Yala improves the prediction accuracy by 78.8% and reduces SLA violations by 92.2% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and enables new practical usecases.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries can be constrained through big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) relic abundances and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, both observables being sensitive to neutrino properties. The latter constraint, which is due to gravitational effects from all neutrino flavors, is very minute since it is at least quadratic in the asymmetries. On the contrary, the constraints from primordial abundances presently dominate, although these abundances are almost only sensitive to the electron flavor asymmetry. It is generally assumed that neutrino asymmetries are sufficiently averaged by flavor oscillations prior to BBN, which allows one to constrain a common primordial neutrino asymmetry at the epoch of BBN. This simplified approach suffers two caveats that we deal with in this article, combining a neutrino evolution code and BBN calculation throughout the MeV era. First, flavor "equilibration" is not true in general, therefore an accurate dynamical evolution of asymmetries is needed to connect experimental observables to the primordial asymmetries. Second, the approximate averaging of asymmetries through flavor oscillations is associated to a reheating of the primordial plasma. It is therefore crucial to correctly describe the interplay between flavor equilibration and neutrino decoupling, as an energy redistribution prior to decoupling does not significantly alter the final effective number of neutrino species' value. Overall, we find that the space of allowed initial asymmetries is generically unbound when using currently available primordial abundances and CMB measurements. We forecast constraints using future CMB experiment capabilities, which should reverse this experimental misfortune.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Simulation of Quantum Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper describes an algorithmic system called SQT for the computer simulation of a wide class of quantum experiments on entangled particles. SQT maintains a hidden internal state for each particle and it provides an initialization process and measurement processes with visual outputs and a means of connecting these in software to make the simulator for a given experiment in Quantum Mechanics. The statistical behavior of the Quantum Mechanical system is replicated by incorporating the probabilities that are observed in real world quantum experiments. SQT is thus a tool to provide educational understanding of quantum systems and this tool removes the mystery surrounding entangled particles. It shows that only initial measurement probabilities and conditional probabilities of transition from the previous state and no earlier to the next state are sufficient inputs for the simulator to replicate all Quantum Mechanical experiments in the simulator and no other inputs such as complex numbers have to be entered into the simulator. The simulator, unlike the real world quantum system, can display the hidden sub-quantum state after which it can be seen that there is no spooky interaction between entangled particles at all. SQT therefore provides a new interpretation of quantum phenomena that may well replace the Copenhagen interpretation founded by Niels Bohr and it answers Einstein's final question regarding whether Quantum Mechanics can be considered a complete theory or not.</description>

      <title>Sample Selection Bias in Machine Learning for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine, their clinical adoption remains limited, partly due to biases that can compromise the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we focus on sample selection bias (SSB), a specific type of bias where the study population is less representative of the target population, leading to biased and potentially harmful decisions. Despite being well-known in the literature, SSB remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare. Moreover, the existing machine learning techniques try to correct the bias mostly by balancing distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in a loss of predictive performance. To address these problems, our study illustrates the potential risks associated with SSB by examining SSB's impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we propose a new research direction for addressing SSB, based on the target population identification rather than the bias correction. Specifically, we propose two independent networks(T-Net) and a multitasking network (MT-Net) for addressing SSB, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the identified subpopulation. Our empirical results with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets highlight that SSB can lead to a large drop in the performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the non-selected patients from the study population. Furthermore, our proposed techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different dataset sizes, event rates, and selection rates, outperforming the existing bias correction techniques.</description>

      <title>Group-Graded Twisted Calabi--Yau Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historically, the study of graded (twisted or otherwise) Calabi--Yau algebras has meant the study of such algebras under an $\mathbb{N}$-grading. In this paper, we propose a suitable definition for a twisted $G$-graded Calabi-Yau algebra, for $G$ an arbitrary abelian group. Building on the work of Reyes and Rogalski, we show that a $G$-graded algebra is twisted Calabi-Yau if and only if it is $G$-graded twisted Calabi--Yau. In the second half of the paper, we prove that localizations of twisted Calabi--Yau algebras at elements which form both left and right denominator sets remain twisted Calabi--Yau. As such, we obtain a large class of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded twisted Calabi--Yau algebras arising as localizations of Artin-Schelter regular algebras. Throughout the paper, we survey a number of concrete examples of $G$-graded twisted Calabi--Yau algebras, including the Weyl algebras, families of generalized Weyl algebras, and universal enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a universal logical gate set in error-detecting surface codes on a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is essential for achieving large-scale practical quantum computation. Implementing arbitrary FTQC requires the execution of a universal gate set on logical qubits, which is highly challenging. Particularly, in the superconducting system, two-qubit gates on surface code logical qubits have not been realized. Here, we experimentally implement a logical CNOT gate along with arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates on distance-2 surface codes using the superconducting quantum processor \textit{Wukong}, thereby demonstrating a universal logical gate set. In the experiment, we demonstrate the transversal CNOT gate on a two-dimensional topological processor based on a tailored encoding circuit, at the cost of removing the ancilla qubits required for stabilizer measurements. Furthermore, we fault-tolerantly prepare logical Bell states and observe a violation of CHSH inequality, confirming the entanglement between logical qubits. Using the logical CNOT gate and an ancilla logical state, arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates are realized through gate teleportation. All logical gates are characterized on a complete state set and their fidelities are evaluated by logical Pauli transfer matrices. The demonstration of a universal logical gate set and the entangled logical states highlights significant aspects of FTQC on superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>CELA: Cost-Efficient Language Model Alignment for CTR Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction holds a paramount position in recommender systems. The prevailing ID-based paradigm underperforms in cold-start scenarios due to the skewed distribution of feature frequency. Additionally, the utilization of a single modality fails to exploit the knowledge contained within textual features. Recent efforts have sought to mitigate these challenges by integrating Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). They design hard prompts to structure raw features into text for each interaction and then apply PLMs for text processing. With external knowledge and reasoning capabilities, PLMs extract valuable information even in cases of sparse interactions. Nevertheless, compared to ID-based models, pure text modeling degrades the efficacy of collaborative filtering, as well as feature scalability and efficiency during both training and inference. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{C}ost-\textbf{E}fficient \textbf{L}anguage Model \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{CELA}) for CTR prediction. CELA incorporates textual features and language models while preserving the collaborative filtering capabilities of ID-based models. This model-agnostic framework can be equipped with plug-and-play textual features, with item-level alignment enhancing the utilization of external information while maintaining training and inference efficiency. Through extensive offline experiments, CELA demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an online A/B test conducted on an industrial App recommender system showcases its practical effectiveness, solidifying the potential for real-world applications of CELA.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Era3D: High-Resolution Multiview Diffusion using Efficient Row-wise Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Era3D, a novel multiview diffusion method that generates high-resolution multiview images from a single-view image. Despite significant advancements in multiview generation, existing methods still suffer from camera prior mismatch, inefficacy, and low resolution, resulting in poor-quality multiview images. Specifically, these methods assume that the input images should comply with a predefined camera type, e.g. a perspective camera with a fixed focal length, leading to distorted shapes when the assumption fails. Moreover, the full-image or dense multiview attention they employ leads to an exponential explosion of computational complexity as image resolution increases, resulting in prohibitively expensive training costs. To bridge the gap between assumption and reality, Era3D first proposes a diffusion-based camera prediction module to estimate the focal length and elevation of the input image, which allows our method to generate images without shape distortions. Furthermore, a simple but efficient attention layer, named row-wise attention, is used to enforce epipolar priors in the multiview diffusion, facilitating efficient cross-view information fusion. Consequently, compared with state-of-the-art methods, Era3D generates high-quality multiview images with up to a 512*512 resolution while reducing computation complexity by 12x times. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Era3D can reconstruct high-quality and detailed 3D meshes from diverse single-view input images, significantly outperforming baseline multiview diffusion methods.

      <title>Federated Learning for Time-Series Healthcare Sensing with Incomplete Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many healthcare sensing applications utilize multimodal time-series data from sensors embedded in mobile and wearable devices. Federated Learning (FL), with its privacy-preserving advantages, is particularly well-suited for health applications. However, most multimodal FL methods assume the availability of complete modality data for local training, which is often unrealistic. Moreover, recent approaches tackling incomplete modalities scale poorly and become inefficient as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose FLISM, an efficient FL training algorithm with incomplete sensing modalities while maintaining high accuracy. FLISM employs three key techniques: (1) modality-invariant representation learning to extract effective features from clients with a diverse set of modalities, (2) modality quality-aware aggregation to prioritize contributions from clients with higher-quality modality data, and (3) global-aligned knowledge distillation to reduce local update shifts caused by modality differences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FLISM not only achieves high accuracy but is also faster and more efficient compared with state-of-the-art methods handling incomplete modality problems in FL. We release the code as open-source at https://github.com/AdibaOrz/FLISM.</description>

      <title>A 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage: nothing crazy!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first empirical evidence on the 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage, implemented in 2022, raising it from Euro 9.82 to 10.45 in July and to Euro 12 in October. Leveraging the German Earnings Survey, a large and novel data source comprising around 8 million employee-level observations reported by employers each month, we apply a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach to analyze the policy's impact on hourly wages, monthly earnings, employment, and working hours. Our findings reveal significant positive effects on wages, affirming the policy's intended benefits for low-wage workers. Interestingly, we identify a negative effect on working hours, mainly driven by minijobbers. The hours effect results in an implied labor demand elasticity in terms of the employment volume of -0.2 which only partially offsets the monthly wage gains. We neither observe a negative effect on the individual's employment retention nor the regional employment levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of the relativistic axial-vector four-current distributions inside a nucleon. We show in particular that the slope of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ in the forward limit -- conventionally denoted as $R^2_A$ in the literature -- does not represent the three-dimensional mean-square axial radius in the Breit frame, but corresponds instead to a contribution to the mean-square spin radius. We derive explicit expressions for the latter in different frames and find in general additional contributions that depend on both the nucleon mass and the forward values of the axial-vector form factors $G_A(0)$ and $G_P(0)$. This provides an additional key motivation for ongoing lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations and future experimental measurements of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G_P(Q^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning-based recommender systems is often hindered by the lack of dynamic and realistic user interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce Lusifer, a novel environment leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate simulated user feedback. Lusifer synthesizes user profiles and interaction histories to simulate responses and behaviors toward recommended items, with profiles updated after each rating to reflect evolving user characteristics. Utilizing the MovieLens dataset as a proof of concept, we limited our implementation to the last 40 interactions for each user, representing approximately 39% and 22% of the training sets, to focus on recent user behavior. For consistency and to gain insights into the performance of traditional methods with limited data, we implemented baseline approaches using the same data subset. Our results demonstrate that Lusifer accurately emulates user behavior and preferences, even with reduced training data having an RMSE of 1.3 across various test sets. This paper presents Lusifer's operational pipeline, including prompt generation and iterative user profile updates, and compares its performance against baseline methods. The findings validate Lusifer's ability to produce realistic dynamic feedback and suggest that it offers a scalable and adjustable framework for user simulation in online reinforcement learning recommender systems for future studies, particularly when training data is limited.</description>

      <title>Extending Kernel Testing To General Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel-based testing has revolutionized the field of non-parametric tests through the embedding of distributions in an RKHS. This strategy has proven to be powerful and flexible, yet its applicability has been limited to the standard two-sample case, while practical situations often involve more complex experimental designs. To extend kernel testing to any design, we propose a linear model in the RKHS that allows for the decomposition of mean embeddings into additive functional effects. We then introduce a truncated kernel Hotelling-Lawley statistic to test the effects of the model, demonstrating that its asymptotic distribution is chi-square, which remains valid with its Nystrom approximation. We discuss a homoscedasticity assumption that, although absent in the standard two-sample case, is necessary for general designs. Finally, we illustrate our framework using a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset and provide kernel-based generalizations of classical diagnostic and exploration tools to broaden the scope of kernel testing in any experimental design.</description>

      <title>Tug-of-war games related to oblique derivative boundary value problems with the normalized $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with game-theoretic interpretations to the following oblique derivative boundary value problem \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \Delta_{p}^{N}u=0 &amp; \textrm{in $ \Omega$,}\\ \langle \beta , Du \rangle + \gamma u = \gamma G &amp; \textrm{on $ \partial \Omega$,}\\ \end{array} \right. \end{align*} where $\Delta_{p}^{N}$ is the normalized $p$-Laplacian. This problem can be regarded as a generalized version of the Robin boundary value problem for the Laplace equations. We construct several types of stochastic games associated with this problem by using `shrinking tug-of-war'. For the value functions of such games, we investigate the properties such as existence, uniqueness, regularity and convergence.</description>

      <title>Generation of vortex electrons by atomic photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is determined solely by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario - a localized finite-sized atomic target - and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>MonoDETRNext: Next-Generation Accurate and Efficient Monocular 3D Object Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection has vast application potential across various fields. DETR-type models have shown remarkable performance in different areas, but there is still considerable room for improvement in monocular 3D detection, especially with the existing DETR-based method, MonoDETR. After addressing the query initialization issues in MonoDETR, we explored several performance enhancement strategies, such as incorporating a more efficient encoder and utilizing a more powerful depth estimator. Ultimately, we proposed MonoDETRNext, a model that comes in two variants based on the choice of depth estimator: MonoDETRNext-E, which prioritizes speed, and MonoDETRNext-A, which focuses on accuracy. We posit that MonoDETRNext establishes a new benchmark in monocular 3D object detection and opens avenues for future research. We conducted an exhaustive evaluation demonstrating the model's superior performance against existing solutions. Notably, MonoDETRNext-A demonstrated a 3.52$\%$ improvement in the $AP_{3D}$ metric on the KITTI test benchmark over MonoDETR, while MonoDETRNext-E showed a 2.35$\%$ increase. Additionally, the computational efficiency of MonoDETRNext-E slightly exceeds that of its predecessor.</description>

      <title>Gibbs states and Brownian models for coexisting haze and cloud droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud microphysics studies include how tiny cloud droplets grow, and become rain. This is crucial for understanding cloud properties like size, lifespan, and impact on climate through radiative effects. Small, weak-updraft clouds near the haze-to-cloud transition are especially difficult to measure and understand. They are abundant but hard to capture by satellites. K\"ohler's theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on K\"ohler's theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplets interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear, white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes. Our approach allows for multimodal cloud's droplet size distributions supported by lab experiments, offering a new perspective on haze-to-cloud transition and small cloud formation.</description>

      <title>FreezeAsGuard: Mitigating Illegal Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Selective Tensor Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits, duplicating copyrighted artworks and generating explicit contents. Existing work focused on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Our approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal adaptations, but minimize the impact on other legal adaptations. Experiment results in multiple text-to-image application domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides 37% stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations compared to competitive baselines, while incurring less than 5% impact on legal model adaptations.

      <title>DiG: Scalable and Efficient Diffusion Models with Gated Linear Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with quadratic complexity efficiency, especially when handling long sequences. In this paper, we aim to incorporate the sub-quadratic modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) into the 2D diffusion backbone. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead. We offer two variants, i,e, a plain and U-shape architecture, showing superior efficiency and competitive effectiveness. In addition to superior performance to DiT and other sub-quadratic-time diffusion models at $256 \times 256$ resolution, DiG demonstrates greater efficiency than these methods starting from a $512$ resolution. Specifically, DiG-S/2 is $2.5\times$ faster and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory compared to DiT-S/2 at a $1792$ resolution. Additionally, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the Mamba-based model at a $1024$ resolution and $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with FlashAttention-2 at a $2048$ resolution. We will release the code soon. Code is released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiG.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning based photon counting for PMT waveforms and its application to the improvement of the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in particle experiments for photon detection. PMT waveform analysis is crucial for high-precision measurements of the position and energy of incident particles in liquid scintillator (LS) detectors. A key factor contributing to the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors with PMTs is the charge smearing of PMTs. This paper presents a machine-learning-based photon counting method for PMT waveforms and its application to the energy reconstruction, using the JUNO experiment as an example.The results indicate that leveraging the photon counting information from the machine learning model can partially mitigate the impact of PMT charge smearing and lead to a relative 2.0% to 2.8% improvement on the energy resolution in the energy range of [1, 9] MeV.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Throwing with Robotic Material Handling Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automation of hydraulic material handling machinery is currently limited to semi-static pick-and-place cycles. Dynamic throwing motions which utilize the passive joints, can greatly improve time efficiency as well as increase the dumping workspace. In this work, we use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to design dynamic controllers for material handlers with underactuated arms as commonly used in logistics. The controllers are tested both in simulation and in real-world experiments on a 12-ton test platform. The method is able to exploit the passive joints of the gripper to perform dynamic throwing motions. With the proposed controllers, the machine is able to throw individual objects to targets outside the static reachability zone with good accuracy for its practical applications. The work demonstrates the possibility of using RL to perform highly dynamic tasks with heavy machinery, suggesting a potential for improving the efficiency and precision of autonomous material handling tasks.</description>

      <title>Prediction Beyond the Medium Range with an Atmosphere-Ocean Model that Combines Physics-based Modeling and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning (ML) with conventional physics-based modeling for weather prediction beyond the medium range. It extends the work of Arcomano et al. (2022), which tested the approach for short- and medium-range weather prediction, and the work of Arcomano et al. (2023), which investigated its potential for climate modeling. The hybrid model used for the forecast experiments of the paper is based on the low-resolution, simplified parameterization atmospheric general circulation model SPEEDY. In addition to the hybridized prognostic variables of SPEEDY, the model has three purely ML-based prognostic variables: the 6h cumulative precipitation, the sea surface temperature, and the heat content of the top 300m deep layer of the ocean (a new addition compared to the model used in Arcomano et al., 2023). The model has skill in predicting the El Nino cycle and its global teleconnections with precipitation for 3-7 months depending on the season. The model captures equatorial variability of the precipitation associated with Kelvin and Rossby waves and MJO. Predictions of the precipitation in the equatorial region have skill for 15 days in the East Pacific and 11.5 days in the West Pacific. Though the model has low spatial resolution, for these tasks it has prediction skill comparable to what has been published for high-resolution, purely physics-based, conventional, operational forecast models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any minimal Cayley graph of a (finitely generated) generalized dihedral or nilpotent group has chromatic number at most 3, while 4 colors are sometimes necessary for soluble groups. On the other hand we construct graphs of unbounded chromatic number that admit a proper edge coloring such that each cycle has some color at least twice. The latter disproves a conjecture of Babai'78 that would have implied that all minimal Cayley graphs have bounded chromatic number -- a problem that remains open.</description>

      <title>EgoSurgery-Phase: A Dataset of Surgical Phase Recognition from Egocentric Open Surgery Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical phase recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential to offer solutions to numerous demands of the modern operating room. However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase. The dataset is released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Anaerobic Digestion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring adequate predictive power of computational models used in biology. Focusing on two anaerobic digestion models, this article introduces a novel generalized Bayesian procedure, called VarBUQ, ensuring a correct tradeoff between flexibility and computational cost. A benchmark against three existing methods (Fisher's information, bootstrapping and Beale's criteria) was conducted using synthetic data. This Bayesian procedure offered a good compromise between fitting ability and confidence estimation, while the other methods proved to be repeatedly overconfident. The method's performances notably benefitted from inductive bias brought by the prior distribution, although it requires careful construction. This article advocates for more systematic consideration of uncertainty for anaerobic digestion models and showcases a new, computationally efficient Bayesian method. To facilitate future implementations, a Python package called 'aduq' is made available.</description>

      <title>Towards Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</description>

      <title>An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iterated learning model is an agent model which simulates the transmission of of language from generation to generation. It is used to study how the language adapts to pressures imposed by transmission. In each iteration, a language tutor exposes a na\"ive pupil to a limited training set of utterances, each pairing a random meaning with the signal that conveys it. Then the pupil becomes a tutor for a new na\"ive pupil in the next iteration. The transmission bottleneck ensures that tutors must generalize beyond the training set that they experienced. Repeated cycles of learning and generalization can result in a language that is expressive, compositional and stable. Previously, the agents in the iterated learning model mapped signals to meanings using an artificial neural network but relied on an unrealistic and computationally expensive process of obversion to map meanings to signals. Here, both maps are neural networks, trained separately through supervised learning and together through unsupervised learning in the form of an autoencoder. This avoids the computational burden entailed in obversion and introduces a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning as observed during language learning in children. The new model demonstrates a linear relationship between the dimensionality of meaning-signal space and effective bottleneck size and suggests that internal reflection on potential utterances is important in language learning and evolution.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic potential immersed in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a modified three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevski equation that describes a static impurity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Our focus is on the interplay between the shape of the impurity and the anisotropy of the medium manifested in the energy and the density of the system. Without external confinement, properties of the system are derived with basic analytical approaches. For a system in a harmonic trap, the model is investigated numerically, using the split-step Crank-Nicolson method. Our results demonstrate that the impurity would prefer to change its shape to accommodate the anisotropic character of the bath, in particular it would prefer to align itself with the direction of the dipoles. Our work complements studies of impurities in Bose gases with zero-range interactions, and paves the way for studies of dipolar polarons with a modified Gross-Pitaevski equation.</description>

      <title>MoS2-based optical bistability in silver-Bragg reflector multilayer structure at visible light band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the optical bistability in a metallic silver-Bragg reflector structure by embedding bilayer MoS2 at the visible band. The nonlinear OB is achieved due to the nonlinear conductivity of the bilayer MoS2 and the excitation of the optical Tamm state at the interface between the silver and the Bragg reflector. It is found that the hysteresis behaviour and the threshold width of the OB can be effectively tuned by varying the incident light wavelength. In addition, the optical bistable behaviour of the structure can be adjusted by varying the position of the MoS2 inset in the defect layer, incident angle and the structural parameters of the spacer layer. Although the current threshold cannot be commercialized, we believe that this solution will provide a meaningful path reference for low threshold bistability in the visible light band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water by developing cryogenic liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (CRYOLIC-TEM). We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Toward regular black holes in sixth-derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric static solutions of the most general sixth-derivative gravity using series expansions. Specifically, we prove that the only solutions of the complete theory (i.e., with generic coupling constants) that possess a Frobenius expansion around the origin, $r=0$, are necessarily regular. When restricted to specific branches of theories (i.e., imposing particular constraints on the coupling constants), families of potentially singular solutions emerge. By expanding around $r=r_0 \neq 0$, we identify solutions with black hole horizons. Finally, we argue that, unlike in fourth-derivative gravity, the conditions $R=0$ and $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ are too restrictive for sixth-derivative gravity solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum machines using $\rm{Cu}_{3}$-like compounds modeled by Heisenberg antiferromagnetic in a triangular ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical study of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{X}$ $(\rm{X=As, Sb})$, characterized by a slightly distorted equilateral triangle configuration is presented. Using the Heisenberg model with exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, g-factors, and an external magnetic field, three quantum machines are investigated using this system as the working substance, assuming reversible processes. For ${\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{X}}$ he magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is significant at low temperatures (around 1K) under a perpendicular magnetic field ($\sim5$T). Although only the $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{As}$ compound is considered, since the $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{Sb}$ compound behaves quite similarly. How MCE influences the Carnot machine, which operates as a heat engine or refrigerator when varying the external magnetic field is analyzed. In contrast, the Otto and Stirling machines can operate as heat engines, refrigerators, heaters, or thermal accelerators, depending on the magnetic field intensity. The results indicate that enhanced MCE broadens the operating regions for these machines, with the Otto and Stirling machines primarily functioning as refrigerators and accelerators. The corresponding thermal efficiencies are also discussed for all operating modes.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correcting for detector effects in experimental data, particularly through unfolding, is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel approach to multidimensional object-wise unfolding using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, incorporating distribution moments as conditioning information, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions, while enabling the unfolding of a wide range of measured distributions with improved adaptability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>EgoSurgery-Tool: A Dataset of Surgical Tool and Hand Detection from Egocentric Open Surgery Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical tool detection is a fundamental task for understanding egocentric open surgery videos. However, detecting surgical tools presents significant challenges due to their highly imbalanced class distribution, similar shapes and similar textures, and heavy occlusion. The lack of a comprehensive large-scale dataset compounds these challenges. In this paper, we introduce EgoSurgery-Tool, an extension of the existing EgoSurgery-Phase dataset, which contains real open surgery videos captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head, along with phase annotations. EgoSurgery-Tool has been densely annotated with surgical tools and comprises over 49K surgical tool bounding boxes across 15 categories, constituting a large-scale surgical tool detection dataset. EgoSurgery-Tool also provides annotations for hand detection with over 46K hand-bounding boxes, capturing hand-object interactions that are crucial for understanding activities in egocentric open surgery. EgoSurgery-Tool is superior to existing datasets due to its larger scale, greater variety of surgical tools, more annotations, and denser scenes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of EgoSurgery-Tool using nine popular object detectors to assess their effectiveness in both surgical tool and hand detection. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.</description>

      <title>Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner. However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community. For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route. Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.
  To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner. Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 13638 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations. We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existing works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in the training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem. Code is available at https://github.com/L-I-M-I-T/LatentNeuralOperator.</description>

      <title>Conti-Fuse: A Novel Continuous Decomposition-based Fusion Framework for Infrared and Visible Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For better explore the relations of inter-modal and inner-modal, even in deep learning fusion framework, the concept of decomposition plays a crucial role. However, the previous decomposition strategies (base \&amp; detail or low-frequency \&amp; high-frequency) are too rough to present the common features and the unique features of source modalities, which leads to a decline in the quality of the fused images. The existing strategies treat these relations as a binary system, which may not be suitable for the complex generation task (e.g. image fusion). To address this issue, a continuous decomposition-based fusion framework (Conti-Fuse) is proposed. Conti-Fuse treats the decomposition results as few samples along the feature variation trajectory of the source images, extending this concept to a more general state to achieve continuous decomposition. This novel continuous decomposition strategy enhances the representation of complementary information of inter-modal by increasing the number of decomposition samples, thus reducing the loss of critical information. To facilitate this process, the continuous decomposition module (CDM) is introduced to decompose the input into a series continuous components. The core module of CDM, State Transformer (ST), is utilized to efficiently capture the complementary information from source modalities. Furthermore, a novel decomposition loss function is also designed which ensures the smooth progression of the decomposition process while maintaining linear growth in time complexity with respect to the number of decomposition samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed Conti-Fuse achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art fusion methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array projects have found evidence of a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) using data from an ensemble of pulsars. In the literature, minimal assumptions are made about the signal and noise processes that affect data from these pulsars, such as pulsar spin noise. These assumptions are encoded as uninformative priors in Bayesian searches, though Frequentist approaches make similar assumptions. Uninformative priors are not suitable for (noise) properties of pulsars in an ensemble, and they bias estimates of model parameters such as gravitational-wave signal parameters. Both Frequentist and Bayesian searches are affected. In this letter, more appropriate priors are proposed in the language of Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling, where the properties of the ensemble of pulsars are jointly described with the properties of the individual components of the ensemble. Results by Pulsar Timing Array projects should be re-evaluated using Hierarchical Models.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and boson density. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glavan and Lin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 081301 (2020)] have recently proposed a model of GB gravity in four spacetime dimensions. This model predicts significant contributions of the GB coupling parameter $\alpha$ to gravitational dynamics, while circumventing the Lovelock theorem and avoiding Ostrogradsky instability. As a powerful competitor to general relativity (GR), the model has been examined on various phenomenological grounds. Here, we employ a technique from information geometry to analyze the thermodynamic phase structure of a charged black hole with a quantum gravity-inspired entropy relation in this novel modified gravity theory scenario. Based on the sign and magnitude of thermodynamic curvature, we demonstrate that while the theory does not significantly impact larger black holes, it may lead to multiple phase transitions and accelerate the formation of black hole remnants at short-distance scales compared to GR. Our analysis focuses solely on the non-extremal geometry case where $M&gt;\sqrt{Q^2+\alpha}$, with $M$ and $Q$ representing the mass and charge of the black hole, respectively. Moreover, since black hole thermodynamics can be effectively analyzed through quantum thermodynamics at microscopic scales, we compute the quantum work associated with the evaporation process of a black hole and demonstrate its intricate behavior in smaller geometric regimes. We believe that these results may offer insights for testing the phenomenological consistency of the theory as a potential alternative to the standard Einstein paradigm.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in filamentous cyanobacteria: from motion to structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many active systems are capable of forming intriguing patterns at scales significantly larger than the size of their individual constituents. Cyanobacteria are one of the most ancient and important phyla of organisms that has allowed the evolution of more complex life forms. Despite its importance, the role of motility on the pattern formation of their colonies is not understood. Here, we investigate the large-scale collective effects and rich dynamics of gliding filamentous cyanobacteria colonies, while still retaining information about the individual constituents' dynamics and their interactions. We investigate both the colony's transient and steady-state dynamics and find good agreement with experiments. We furthermore show that the Peclet number and aligning interaction strength govern the system's topological transition from an isotropic distribution to a state of large-scale reticulate patterns. Although the system is topologically non-trivial, the parallel and perpendicular pair correlation functions provide structural information about the colony, and thus can be used to extract information about the early stages of biofilm formation. Finally, we find that the effects of the filaments' length cannot be reduced to a system of interacting points. Our model proves to reproduce both cyanobacteria colonies and systems of biofilaments where curvature is transported by motility.</description>

      <title>Growth and characterization of the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films: dominant contribution of the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the pulsed-laser-ablation technique, we have successfully grown the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films with $c$-axis orientation perpendicular to the film surface. X-ray diffraction shows that the (00l) peaks can be well indexed to the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ phase. Resistive measurements show that the samples can be tuned from weak insulating to metallic behavior through adjusting the growth conditions. Surprisingly, all curves of $\rho-T$ in the temperature region of 2$\sim$300~K do not show the anomalies corresponding to either the spin density wave or the charge density wave orders as seen in bulk samples. Hall effect measurements show a linear field dependence with the dominant hole charge carriers, but the Hall coefficient $R_{H}=\rho_{xy}/H$ exhibits strong temperature dependence. The magnetoresistance above about 50~K is positive but very weak, indicating a weakened or absence of multiband effect. However, a negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures, which shows the delocalization effect by magnetic field. Detailed analysis on the magnetoresistance suggests that the delocalization effect at low temperatures is due to the Kondo-like effect, rather than the Anderson weak localization. Our transport results suggest that, the electronic conduction is fulfilled by the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital with holes as the dominant charge carriers, while the interaction through Hund's coupling with the localized $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital plays an important role in the charge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Freudenthal Duality in Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational Freudenthal duality (RFD) relates two extremal Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes (BHs) with different angular momenta and electric-magnetic charges, but with the same Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Through the Kerr/CFT correspondence (and its KN extension), a four-dimensional, asymptotically flat extremal KN BH is endowed with a dual thermal, two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) such that the Cardy entropy of the CFT is the same as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the KN BH itself. Using this connection, we study the effect of the RFD on the thermal CFT dual to the KN extremal (or doubly-extremal) BH. We find that the RFD maps two different thermal, two-dimensional CFTs with different temperatures and central charges, but with the same asymptotic density of states, thereby matching the Cardy entropy. We also discuss the action of the RFD on doubly-extremal rotating BHs, finding a spurious branch in the non-rotating limit, and determining that for this class of BH solutions the image of the RFD necessarily over-rotates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows the analysis of perturbations with Kerr-like asymptotics well inside the Melvin radius, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modeling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My work uses ideas from statistical physics, calculus of variations, and SPDEs, providing alternative methods that complement the measure-theoretic martingale approach that is more common in the literature.</description>

      <title>Performance Improvement of Language-Queried Audio Source Separation Based on Caption Augmentation From Large Language Models for DCASE Challenge 2024 Task 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prompt-engineering-based text-augmentation approach applied to a language-queried audio source separation (LASS) task. To enhance the performance of LASS, the proposed approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate multiple captions corresponding to each sentence of the training dataset. To this end, we first perform experiments to identify the most effective prompts for caption augmentation with a smaller number of captions. A LASS model trained with these augmented captions demonstrates improved performance on the DCASE 2024 Task 9 validation set compared to that trained without augmentation. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLM-based caption augmentation in advancing language-queried audio source separation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Neural Network Symmetrisation in Markov Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XY model on the honeycomb lattice: A comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examined the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in the two-dimensional XY model on the honeycomb lattice. To address its thermodynamical behavior, we conducted standard numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the Simulated Annealing (SA) protocol and entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm. The inverse transition temperature ($\beta_{BKT}$) was determined using the second ($\Upsilon$) and fourth-order ($\Upsilon_4$) helicity modulus as the order parameter. We also used the fourth-order Binder cumulant of the magnetization as an additional tool to address the critical properties of the model. Our finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis suggests $\beta_{BKT} = 1.696(3)$ from $\Upsilon$ and $\beta_{BKT}=1.67(1)$ from $\Upsilon_4$. From the Binder cumulant crossing we found $\beta_{BKT}=1.724(2)$. These values deviate significantly from the expected theoretical value of $\sqrt{2}$. We believe that this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical assumptions regarding the analytical calculation may need to be revisited. Additionally, we calculated the vortex density and the formation energy of the vortex-antivortex pairs, where the obtained vortex formation energy is $2\mu=4.0(5)$. Upon comparison with the square lattice, our results support the notion of instability of the honeycomb lattice and give additional backing to the critical behavior we found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12315v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural pruning has emerged as a promising approach for producing more efficient models. Nevertheless, the community suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, leaving the progress in this area not fully comprehended.To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark, termed PruningBench, for structural pruning. PruningBench showcases the following three characteristics: 1) PruningBench employs a unified and consistent framework for evaluating the effectiveness of diverse structural pruning techniques; 2) PruningBench systematically evaluates 16 existing pruning methods, encompassing a wide array of models (e.g., CNNs and ViTs) and tasks (e.g., classification and detection); 3) PruningBench provides easily implementable interfaces to facilitate the implementation of future pruning methods, and enables the subsequent researchers to incorporate their work into our leaderboards. We provide an online pruning platform http://pruning.vipazoo.cn for customizing pruning tasks and reproducing all results in this paper. Leaderboard results can be available on https://github.com/HollyLee2000/PruningBench.</description>

      <title>The evolution of low-mass central galaxies in the vicinity of massive structures and its impact on the two-halo conformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the population of low-mass central galaxies with Mstar = $10^{9.5}-10^{10}$ Msun/h, inhabiting regions near massive groups and clusters of galaxies using the TNG300 and MDPL2-SAG simulations. We set out to study their evolutionary histories, aiming to find hints about the large-scale conformity signal they produce. We also used a control sample of central galaxies with the same stellar mass range located far away from massive structures. For both samples, we find a subpopulation of galaxies accreted by another halo in the past, but now considered central galaxies; we refer to these objects as former satellites. The number of former satellites is higher for quenched central galaxies near massive systems, with fractions of 45% and 17% in TNG300 and MDPL2-SAG. Our results in TNG300 show that former satellites pollute the sample of central galaxies because they suffered environmental processes when they were satellites hosted typically by massive dark matter halos (M200 $\geq 10^{13}$ Msun/h) since z$\lesssim$0.5. After removing former satellites, the evolutionary trends for quenched central galaxies near massive structures are fairly similar to those of the quenched control galaxies, showing small differences at low redshift. For MDPL2-SAG instead, former satellites were hosted by less massive halos, with a mean halo mass around $10^{11.4}$ Msun/h, and the evolutionary trends remain equal before and after removing former satellite galaxies. We also measured the two-halo conformity, i.e, the correlation in the sSFR between low-mass central galaxies and their neighbors at Mpc scales, and how former satellites contribute to the signal at three different redshifts: z=0, 0.3, and 1. The time evolution of the conformity signal in the simulations presents apparent contradictory results: it decreases from z=0 to z=1 in MDPL2-SAG, while it increases in TNG300 (abridged).</description>

      <title>The Source of Hydrogen in Earth's Building Blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being pivotal to the habitability of our planet, the process by which Earth gained its present-day hydrogen budget is unclear. Due to their isotopic similarity to terrestrial rocks across a range of elements, the meteorite group that is thought to best represent Earth's building blocks is the enstatite chondrites (ECs). Because of ECs' nominally anhydrous mineralogy, these building blocks have long been presumed to have supplied negligible hydrogen to the proto-Earth. However, recent bulk compositional measurements suggest that ECs may unexpectedly contain enough hydrogen to readily explain Earth's present-day water abundance. Together, these contradictory findings mean the contribution of ECs to Earth's water budget is currently unclear. As such, it is uncertain whether appreciable water is a systematic outcome of Earth's formation. Here, we explore the amount of hydrogen in ECs as well as the phase that may carry this element using sulfur X-ray absorption near edge structure (S-XANES) spectroscopy. We find that most (~80 wt%) of the measured bulk hydrogen concentration of these meteorites is bonded to sulfur. Moreover, the concentration of the S-H bond is intimately linked to the abundance of micrometre-scale pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS, 0&lt;x&lt;0.125), suggesting most hydrogen in these meteorites is carried in this phase. These findings indicate that hydrogen is present in ECs in higher concentrations than previously considered and argue this element has a systematic, rather than stochastic, origin on our planet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Job shop scheduling problems (JSSPs) represent a critical and challenging class of combinatorial optimization problems. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</description>

      <title>Region-Specific Coarse Quantization with Check Node Awareness in 5G-LDPC Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents novel techniques for improving the error correction performance and reducing the complexity of coarsely quantized 5G-LDPC decoders. The proposed decoder design supports arbitrary message-passing schedules on a base-matrix level by modeling exchanged messages with entry-specific discrete random variables. Variable nodes (VNs) and check nodes (CNs) involve compression operations designed using the information bottleneck method to maximize preserved mutual information between code bits and quantized messages. We introduce alignment regions that assign the messages to groups with aligned reliability levels to decrease the number of individual design parameters. Group compositions with degree-specific separation of messages improve performance by up to 0.4 dB. Further, we generalize our recently proposed CN-aware quantizer design to irregular LDPC codes and layered schedules. The method optimizes the VN quantizer to maximize preserved mutual information at the output of the subsequent CN update, enhancing performance by up to 0.2 dB. A schedule optimization modifies the order of layer updates, reducing the average iteration count by up to 35 %. We integrate all new techniques in a rate-compatible decoder design by extending the alignment regions along a rate-dimension. Our complexity analysis shows that 2-bit decoding can double the area efficiency over 4-bit decoding without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>How language models extrapolate outside the training data: A case study in Textualized Gridworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models' ability to extrapolate learned behaviors to novel, more complex environments beyond their training scope is highly unknown. This study introduces a path planning task in a textualized Gridworld to probe language models' extrapolation capabilities. We show that conventional approaches, including next token prediction and Chain of Thought (CoT) finetuning, fail to extrapolate in larger, unseen environments. Inspired by human cognition and dual process theory, we propose cognitive maps for path planning, a novel CoT framework that simulates humanlike mental representations. Our experiments show that cognitive maps not only enhance extrapolation to unseen environments but also exhibit humanlike characteristics through structured mental simulation and rapid adaptation. Our finding that these cognitive maps require specialized training schemes and cannot be induced through simple prompting opens up important questions about developing general-purpose cognitive maps in language models. Our comparison with exploration-based methods further illuminates the complementary strengths of offline planning and online exploration.</description>

Abstract: The recent success of interleaved Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in few-shot learning suggests that in-context learning (ICL) with many examples can be promising for learning new tasks. However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV) -- compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.

      <title>A model-independent measurement of the expansion and growth rates from BOSS using the FreePower method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a data analysis of the BOSS galaxy clustering data with the recently proposed FreePower method, which adopts as parameters the power spectrum band-powers, the expansion rate, and the growth rate instead of specific cosmological parametrizations. It relies on the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect and redshift-space distortions, and makes use of one-loop perturbation theory for biased tracers. In this way, we obtain for the first time constraints on the linear growth rate, on the Hubble parameter, as well as on the dimensionless distance $H_0 D_A$ and various bias functions, that are independent of a model for the power spectrum shape and thus of both the early and late-time cosmological modelling. Using broad priors we find at $z_{\rm eff}=0.38$, $f=0.67^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, $H/H_0=1.033^{+0.13}_{-0.081}$, $H_0 D_A = 0.264^{+0.026}_{-0.039}$ and at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$, $f=0.82^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$, $H/H_0=1.085^{+0.16}_{-0.067}$, $H_0 D_A = 0.390^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We find lower $H/H_0$ results than expected from Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM results at a confidence level of $1.7\sigma$ $(2.1\sigma)$ for low-$z$ (hi-$z$). The precision in these results demonstrates the capabilities of the FreePower method. We also get constraints on the bias parameters which are in agreement with constraints from previous BOSS analyses, which serves as a cross-check of our pipeline.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the work about solutions of a system of real polynomial equations done by Hermite, this paper introduces a Hermitian form, which encodes information about solutions of a system of complex polynomial equations with conjugate variables. Adopting the presented object, a new general bound for the number of solutions of an harmonic polynomial equation is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $\mathrm{LMod}_{R}(\mathcal{V})$-enriched $\infty$-categories, where $R$ is an $\mathbb{E}_1$-ring in a presentable $\mathbb{E}_2$-monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$, using $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-category theory. We prove the equivalence of $\mathcal{C}at_{\infty}^{\mathrm{LMod}_{R}(\mathcal{V})}$ (the $\infty$-category of $\mathrm{LMod}_{R}(\mathcal{V})$-enriched $\infty$-categories) and $\mathrm{LMod}_{R}(\mathcal{C}at_{\infty}^{\mathcal{V}})$ (left $R$-modules in $\mathcal{C}at_{\infty}^{\mathcal{V}}$). For $R$ an $\mathbb{E}_2$-ring in a presentable $\mathbb{E}_3$-monoidal $\infty$-category, they are also equivalent to $Fun^{\mathcal{C}at_{\infty}^{\mathcal{V}}}(B^2R,\mathcal{C}at_{\infty}^{\mathcal{V}})$, where $B^2(-)$ is the "$2$-delooping". This result generalizes: if $R$ is an $\mathbb{E}_n$-ring in a presentable $\mathbb{E}_{n+1}$-monoidal $\infty$-category, $(\infty,n)$-categories enriched in $\mathrm{LMod}_{R}(\mathcal{V})$ are equivalent to $B^nR$-modules in $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $(\infty,n)$-categories, where $B^n(-)$ is the "$n$-delooping". A notable case is $\mathcal{V} = \mathcal{S}p$ and $R = \mathbb{H}\mathrm{k}$, the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum of a commutative ring $k$. In this case, the results provide two new descriptions of $\mathcal{D}(k)$ the $\infty$-category of dg-categories over $k$, a key object in derived algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic medium rotation measure of primordial magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

      <title>Exploring Simple-Population and Multiple-Population Globular Clusters in the Outer Galactic Halo using the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs) that consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using the ChM have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on high-precision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately 10^5 M$_{\odot}$. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W - F814W color spreads, likely indicative of [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05 -- 0.30 dex. This suggests that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.</description>

      <title>On several irrationality problems for Ahmes series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using basic tools of mathematical analysis and elementary probability theory we address several problems on the irrationality of series of distinct unit fractions, $\sum_k 1/a_k$. In particular, we study subseries of the Lambert series $\sum_k 1/(t^k-1)$ and two types of irrationality sequences $(a_k)$ introduced by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ronald Graham. Next, we address a question of Erd\H{o}s, who asked how rapidly a sequence of positive integers $(a_k)$ can grow if both series $\sum_k 1/a_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(a_k+1)$ have rational sums. Our construction of double exponentially growing sequences $(a_k)$ with this property generalizes to any number $d$ of series $\sum_k 1/(a_k+j)$, $j=0,1,2,\ldots,d-1$, and, in particular, also gives a positive answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Ernst Straus on the interior of the set of $d$-tuples of their sums. Finally, we prove the existence of a sequence $(a_k)$ such that all well-defined sums $\sum_k 1/(a_k+t)$, $t\in\mathbb{Z}$, are rational numbers, giving a negative answer to a conjecture by Kenneth Stolarsky.</description>

      <title>Managing Classical Processing Requirements for Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction requires decoders to process syndromes generated by the error-correction circuits. These decoders must process syndromes faster than they are being generated to prevent a backlog of undecoded syndromes. This backlog can exponentially increase the time required to execute the program, which has resulted in the development of fast hardware decoders that accelerate decoding. Applications utilizing error-corrected quantum computers will require hundreds to thousands of logical qubits and provisioning a hardware decoder for every logical qubit can be very costly. In this work, we present a framework to reduce the number of hardware decoders and navigate the compute-performace trade-offs without sacrificing the performance or reliability of program execution. Through workload-centric characterizations performed by our framework, we propose efficient decoder scheduling policies that can reduce the number of hardware decoders required to run a program by up to 10X. With the proposed framework, scalability can be achieved via decoder virtualization, and individual decoders can be built to maximize accuracy and performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to establish the geometrical finiteness for the natural isometric actions of (birational) automorphism groups on the hyperbolic spaces for K3 surfaces, Enriques surfaces, Coble surfaces, and irreducible symplectic varieties.
  As an application, it follows that such groups are non-positively curved: ${\rm CAT(0)}$ and relatively hyperbolic. In the case of K3 surfaces, we provide a dynamical characterization of relative hyperbolicity, and clarify the relationship between convex-cocompactness and genus one fibrations.</description>

      <title>CanFields: Consolidating 4D Dynamic Shapes from Raw Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Canonical Consolidation Fields (CanFields), a new method for reconstructing a time series of independently captured 3D scans into a single, coherent deforming shape. This 4D representation enables continuous refinement across both space and time. Unlike prior methods that often over-smooth the geometry or produce topological and geometric artifacts, CanFields effectively learns geometry and deformation in an unsupervised way by incorporating two geometric priors. First, we introduce a dynamic consolidator module that adjusts the input and assigns confidence scores, balancing the learning of the canonical shape and its deformations. Second, we use low-frequency velocity fields to guide deformation while preserving fine details in canonical shapes through high-frequency bias. We validate the robustness and accuracy of CanFields on diverse raw scans, demonstrating its superior performance even with missing regions, sparse frames, and noise. Code is available in the supplementary materials and will be released publicly upon acceptance.</description>

Abstract: We present a Brownian dynamics simulation of the bacterial Stirling engine studied by Krishnamurthy et al., Nat. Phys. 12, 1134 (2016). In their experimental setup, an overdamped colloid in an optical trap with time-modulated stiffness interacts with a bacterial bath that we represent by an ensemble of overdamped active particles. In the parameter regime of the experiment the thermodynamic performance is governed by an effective temperature and can be parametrized analytically by active Brownian particle models. We quantitatively reproduce the efficiencies reported for the experiments under the assumption that energy exchange with the bath during isochores of the cycle is entirely recuperated and in agreement with the second law.</description>

      <title>Case for Centaurus A as the main source of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that a dominant fraction of the cosmic rays above the ankle is due to a single nearby source, considering in particular the radio galaxy Centaurus A. We focus on the properties of the source spectrum and composition required to reproduce the observations, showing that the nuclei are strongly suppressed for E&gt;10Z EeV, either by a rigidity dependent source cutoff or by the photodisintegration interactions with the CMB at the giant dipole resonance. The very mild attenuation effects at lower energies imply that the secondary nuclei from this source only provide a small contribution. Given the moderate anisotropies observed, the deflections in extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields should play a crucial role in determining the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution. The diffusion in extragalactic fields as well as the finite source lifetime also significantly affect the shape of the observed spectrum. The cosmic ray flux at tens of EeV is dominated by the CNO component, and we show that it is actually better reproduced by a mixture of C and O nuclei rather than by the usual assumption of a N component effectively describing this mass group. The Si and Fe group components become dominant above 70 EeV, in the energy range in which a strong spectral suppression is present. If the localised flux excess appearing above 40 EeV around the Centaurus A direction is attributed to the CNO component, the He nuclei from the source in the energy range from 10 to 20 EeV could lead to a similar anisotropy unless its contribution is suppressed. The cosmic ray flux at a few EeV should mostly result from a more isotropic light component associated to a population of extragalactic sources. The inclusion of the subdominant contribution of heavy nuclei from the Galactic component helps to reproduce the observations around 1 EeV.</description>

      <title>Simulating Classroom Education with LLM-Empowered Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been applied across various intelligent educational tasks to assist teaching. While preliminary studies have focused on task-specific, independent LLM-empowered agents, the potential of LLMs within a multi-agent collaborative framework for classroom simulation with real user participation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose SimClass, a multi-agent classroom simulation teaching framework. We recognize representative class roles and introduce a novel class control mechanism for automatic classroom teaching, and conduct user experiments in two real-world courses. Using the Flanders Interactive Analysis System and Community of Inquiry theoretical frameworks from educational analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate a dynamic learning environment for users with active teacher-student and student-student interactions. We also observe group behaviors among agents in SimClass, where agents collaborate to create enlivening interactions in classrooms to improve user learning process. We hope this work pioneers the application of LLM-empowered multi-agent systems in virtual classroom teaching.</description>

Abstract: Currently, there are many quantization methods appeared for LLM quantization, yet few are user-friendly and easy to be deployed locally. Packages like TensorRT and Quantohave many underlying structures and self-invoking internal functions, which are not conducive to developers' personalized development and learning for deployment. Therefore, we develop LLMEasyQuant, it is a package aiming to for easy quantization deployment which is user-friendly and suitable for beginners' learning.</description>

Abstract: We use Brownian dynamics simulations to study a model of a cyclic bacterial heat engine based on a harmonically confined colloidal probe particle in a bath formed by active Brownian particles. For intermediate activities, active noise experienced by large enough probes becomes Gaussian with exponential autocorrelation function. We show that, in this experimentally pertinent regime, the probability densities for stochastic work, heat, and efficiency are well represented by those of an effective active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle (AOUP). Due to the probe's fast relaxation in the potential in typical experimental implementations, good agreement can prevail even when the noise autocorrelation function develops non-exponential tails. Our results show that the AOUP provides a convenient and accurate, analytically tractable effective model to mimic and analyze experimental bacterial heat engines, especially when operating with comparatively large probes and stiff traps.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of the Regge-eikonal model of hadron interaction based on the analyticity of the scattering amplitude with taking into account the hadron structure, a simultaneous analysis is carried out of 90 sets of data. These sets include the data were obtained at low energies ($\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.6 $ GeV and high energies at FNAL, ISR, $SP\bar{P}S$, TEVATRON and LHC with 4326 experimental points, including the data of $A_N$. The energy and momentum transfer dependence of separate sets of data is analyzed on the basis of the eikonalized Born amplitude with taking into account two additional anomalous terms. Different origins of the nonlinear behavior of the slope of the scattering amplitude are compared. No contribution of hard-Pomeron in the elastic hadron scattering is found. The importance of Odderon's contribution is presented. In the framework of the HEGS model, using the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors, the differential cross sections in the CNI region and at large $t$ are described well in a wide energy region simultaneously. It is shown that the cross-even part includes the soft pomeron and the additional term with a large slope have energy dependence $\ln^2(s)$. The cross-odd part includes the maximal odderon term with $\ln^{2}(s)$ and an additional oscillation term with $\ln(s)$. It is shown that the additional terms with large slope are proportional to charge distributions but the maximal odderon term and oscillation term are proportional to matter distributions. Also, a good description of proton-neutron differential scattering with 526 experimental points is obtained on the basis of the amplitudes taken from the analysis of $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ scattering. A good description of the $A_N$ data was also obtained.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Spatially-Dependent Variable Order in One-Dimensional Subdiffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate an inverse problem of identifying a spatially variable order in the one-dimensional subdiffusion model from the boundary flux measurement. The model involves a generalized Caputo derivative in time, and arises in the mathematical modeling of anomalous diffusion in heterogeneous media. We prove the unique recovery of a monotone piecewise constant variable order and its range for known and unknown media, respectively. The analysis is based on a delicate asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transform of the data as $p\to0$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for 3D Scene Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose UniSeg3D, a unified 3D scene understanding framework that achieves panoptic, semantic, instance, interactive, referring, and open-vocabulary segmentation tasks within a single model. Most previous 3D segmentation approaches are typically tailored to a specific task, limiting their understanding of 3D scenes to a task-specific perspective. In contrast, the proposed method unifies six tasks into unified representations processed by the same Transformer. It facilitates inter-task knowledge sharing, thereby promoting comprehensive 3D scene understanding. To take advantage of multi-task unification, we enhance performance by establishing explicit inter-task associations. Specifically, we design knowledge distillation and contrastive learning methods to transfer task-specific knowledge across different tasks. Experiments on three benchmarks, including ScanNet20, ScanRefer, and ScanNet200, demonstrate that the UniSeg3D consistently outperforms current SOTA methods, even those specialized for individual tasks. We hope UniSeg3D can serve as a solid unified baseline and inspire future work. Code and models are available at https://github.com/dk-liang/UniSeg3D.</description>

      <title>Improved Noise Schedule for Diffusion Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto choice for generating high-quality visual signals across various domains. However, training a single model to predict noise across various levels poses significant challenges, necessitating numerous iterations and incurring significant computational costs. Various approaches, such as loss weighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced to expedite convergence and improve model performance. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design the noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise ratio ($\log \text{SNR}$), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample frequency around $\log \text{SNR}=0$. This strategic sampling allows the model to focus on the critical transition point between signal dominance and noise dominance, potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions.We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule.Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits different prediction targets. Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to optimize diffusion models, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective training paradigms in the field of generative AI.</description>

      <title>Biometric Authentication Based on Enhanced Remote Photoplethysmography Signal Morphology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

Abstract: For any constant $C_0&gt;0$, we construct a set $A \subset {\mathbb N}$ such that one has $$ \sum_{n \in A: n \leq x} \frac{1}{n} = \exp\left(\left(\frac{C_0}{2}+o(1)\right) (\log\log x)^{1/2} \log\log\log x \right)$$ and $$ \sum_{n,m \in A: n, m \leq x} \frac{1}{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} \ll_{C_0} \left(\sum_{n \in A: n \leq x} \frac{1}{n}\right)^2$$ as $x \to \infty$, with the growth rate given here optimal up to the dependence on $C_0$. This answers in the negative a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, and also clarifies the nature of certain ``mostly coprime'' sets studied by Bergelson and Richter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically compute the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in Type III hilltop inflation models under the slow-roll approximation. The model parameters are constrained using current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The curvature perturbations that exit the horizon at small scales show sufficiently large amplitudes to produce primordial black holes (PBHs). We then consider the quantum one-loop corrections in these models from both the self-interaction of the inflaton and its interaction with the waterfall field. We show the loop corrections in both cases for 60 e-folds of inflation are negligible, ensuring the tree-level results are reliable within the chosen parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Constrained Online Recursive Source Separation Framework for Real-time Electrophysiological Signal Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Processing electrophysiological signals often requires blind source separation (BSS) due to the nature of mixing source signals. However, its complex computational demands make real-time BSS challenging. The objective of this work is to develop an advanced real-time BSS method suitable for processing electrophysiological signals. Methods: In this paper, a novel BSS framework termed constrained online recursive source separation (CORSS) was proposed. In the framework, a stepwise recursive unmixing matrix learning rule was adopted to enable real-time updates with minimal computational cost. Moreover, by incorporating prior information of target signals to optimize the cost function, the framework algorithm was more likely to converge to the target sources. To validate its performance, the proposed framework was applied to both downstream tasks, namely real-time surface electromyogram (sEMG) decomposition and real-time respiratory intent monitoring based on diaphragmatic electromyogram (sEMGdi) extraction. Results: The proposed method achieved a matching rate of 96.00 % for the sEMG decomposition task and 98.12 % for the sEMGdi extraction task, exhibiting superior performance over other comparison methods (p &lt; 0.05). Our method also exhibited minimal time delay during computation, with only 12.5 ms delay when the block size was 0.1s, demonstrating its good capabilities in online processing. Conclusions: The proposed method was demonstrated to enable real-time BSS with both improved separation performance and low computational latency. It is of substantial importance for real-time electrophysiological signal processing and applications towards advanced neural-machine interaction and clinical monitoring.</description>

      <title>Hecaton: Training Large Language Models with Scalable Chiplet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, but their training and finetuning require massive computation and memory, necessitating parallelism which introduces heavy communication overheads. Driven by advances in packaging, the chiplet architecture emerges as a potential solution, as it can integrate computing power, as well as utilize on-package links with better signal integrity, higher bandwidth, and lower energy consumption. However, most existing chiplet-related works focus on DNN inference. Directly porting them to LLM training introduces significantly large quantities of DRAM access and network-on-package (NoP) overheads which make state-of-the-art chiplet designs fail, highlighting a research gap.
  This work proposes Hecaton, a scalable and cost-effective chiplet system for LLM training. We first provide a chiplet architecture with tailored scheduling that can largely reduce DRAM accesses. We further design an efficient distributed training method that reduces NoP communication complexity and relieves constraints on SRAM capacity and layout. Theoretical analysis shows that the entire system achieves weak scaling: as the workload and hardware resources grow proportionally, the computation-to-communication ratio remains nearly constant. Experiments with various workloads and hardware configurations verify the property, and Hecaton achieves $5.29\times$ performance improvement and $3.46\times$ energy reduction on Llama3.1-405B, compared to the tensor parallelism in Megatron. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first chiplet architecture specifically used for LLM training or finetuning, with guaranteed performance regardless of the problem scale.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the impact of an additional corrugated structure impedance on the bursting dynamics in an electron storage ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the case of single-digit picosecond bunch length, synchrotron light sources produce intense coherent radiation up to the THz range. The reduction of the bunch length by lowering the momentum compaction factor (low-$\alpha$) gives rise to the micro-bunching instability, which is on one hand a crucial roadblock in the X-ray range during to the resulting effective bunch lengthening but on the other hand also an opportunity for the generation of intense THz radiation if it can be controlled appropriately. In the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator), two parallel plates with periodic rectangular corrugations are planned to be installed in an electron storage ring. These plates create an additional longitudinal impedance based on their geometry, which can affect the beam dynamics. The resulting impedance manipulation will be used to study and control the longitudinal electron beam dynamics and the emitted coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). This paper presents the results of systematic studies in simulation of the impact of additional corrugated plate impedances on the longitudinal beam dynamics using the example of the KARA storage ring. If the periodicity of the wake function of the corrugated plates matches the size of the substructures in the longitudinal bunch profile, the instability threshold can be effectively manipulated. This extends intense THz radiation to different beam current regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding biological functions requires identifying the physical limits and system-specific constraints that have shaped them. In Escherichia coli chemotaxis, gradient-climbing speed is information-limited, bounded by the sensory information they acquire from real-time measurements of their environment. However, it remains unclear what limits this information. Past work conjectured that E. coli's chemosensing is limited by the physics of molecule arrivals at their sensors. Here, we derive the physical limit on behaviorally-relevant information, and then perform single-cell experiments to quantify how much information E. coli's signaling pathway encodes. We find that E. coli encode two orders of magnitude less information than the physical limit due to their stochastic signal processing. Thus, system-specific constraints, rather than the physical limit, have shaped the evolution of this canonical sensory-motor behavior.</description>

Abstract: Let S be a symmetric relation with deficiency index (1,1). In this article, we extend Krein`s resolvent formalism in order to describe all, not necessarily self-adjoint, extensions $S \subset \tilde{A}$ with $\varrho(\tilde{A})\neq \emptyset$. The corresponding $Q$-functions turn out to be quasi-Herglotz functions. We will use their structure to characterize the spectrum of such extensions. Finally, we also provide a model for such an extension on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space when $S$ is simple.</description>

Abstract: Presently, Bangladesh is expending substantial efforts to digitize its national infrastructure, with a significant emphasis on achieving this goal through mobile applications that facilitate online payments and banking system advancements. Despite the lack of knowledge about the security level of these systems, they are currently in frequent use without much consideration. To observe whether they follow the minimum global set standards, we choose to conduct static and dynamic analysis of the applications using available open-source analyzers and open-source tools. This allows us to attempt to extract sensitive information, if possible, and determine whether the applications adhere to the standards of MASVS set by OWASP. We show how we analyzed 17 .apks and a SDK using open source scanner and discover security flaws to the applications, such as weaknesses related to data storage, vulnerable cryptographic elements, insecure network communications, and unsafe utilization of WebViews, detected by the scanner. These outputs demonstrate the need for extensive manual analysis of the application through source code review and dynamic analysis. We further implement reverse engineering and dynamic approach to verify the outputs and expose some applications do not comply with the standard method of network communication. Moreover, we attempt to verify the rest of the potential vulnerabilities in the next phase of our ongoing investigation.</description>

Abstract: We present two methods for computing the dynamic structure factor for warm dense hydrogen without invoking either the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or the Chihara decomposition, by employing a wave-packet description that resolves the electron dynamics during ion evolution. First, a semiclassical method is discussed, which is corrected based on known quantum constraints, and second, a direct computation of the density response function within the molecular dynamics. The wave packet models are compared to PIMC and DFT-MD for the static and low-frequency behaviour. For the high-frequency behaviour the models recover the expected behaviour in the limits of small and large momentum transfers and show the characteristic flattening of the plasmon dispersion for intermediate momentum transfers due to interactions, in agreement with commonly used models for x-ray Thomson scattering. By modelling the electrons and ions on an equal footing, both the ion and free electron part of the spectrum can now be treated within a single framework where we simultaneously resolve the ion-acoustic and plasmon mode, with a self-consistent description of collisions and screening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

      <title>Hamba: Single-view 3D Hand Reconstruction with Graph-guided Bi-Scanning Mamba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction.

      <title>Cooling of gold cluster anions, Au$_N^-$, $N=2-13,15$, in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the spontaneous and photo-induced decays of anionic gold clusters, Au$_N^-$, with sizes ranging from $N = 2$ to 13, and 15. After production in a sputter ion source, the size-selected clusters were stored in the cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring DESIREE and their neutralization decays were measured for storage times between 0.1 and 100 s. The dimer was observed to decay by electron emission in parallel to neutral atom emission at long times, analogously to the behavior of copper and silver dimers, implying a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Radiative cooling is observed for all cluster sizes except for the dimer. The decay rates of clusters $N=3,6,8-13,15$ show only a single radiative cooling time. For $N=6-13$ the cooling times have a strong odd-even oscillation with an amplitude that decrease with cluster size, and with the even $N$ having the fast cooling. We compare our results with previous measurements of radiative cooling rates of the corresponding cationic gold clusters, Au$_N^+$, which also show an odd-even effect with a similar oscillation amplitude but at orders of magnitude shorter time scales, and out of phase with the anions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Patch Contrast for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) using only image-level labels has gained significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness. The typical framework involves using image-level labels as training data to generate pixel-level pseudo-labels with refinements. Recently, methods based on Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated superior capabilities in generating reliable pseudo-labels, particularly in recognizing complete object regions, compared to CNN methods. However, current ViT-based approaches have some limitations in the use of patch embeddings, being prone to being dominated by certain abnormal patches, as well as many multi-stage methods being time-consuming and lengthy in training, thus lacking efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel ViT-based WSSS method named \textit{Adaptive Patch Contrast} (APC) that significantly enhances patch embedding learning for improved segmentation effectiveness. APC utilizes an Adaptive-K Pooling (AKP) layer to address the limitations of previous max pooling selection methods. Additionally, we propose a Patch Contrastive Learning (PCL) to enhance patch embeddings, thereby further improving the final results. Furthermore, we improve upon the existing multi-stage training framework without CAM by transforming it into an end-to-end single-stage training approach, thereby enhancing training efficiency. The experimental results show that our approach is effective and efficient, outperforming other state-of-the-art WSSS methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 dataset within a shorter training duration.</description>

      <title>Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for transport models in porous materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Distributed Prescribed-Time Convex Optimization: Cascade Design and Time-Varying Gain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed prescribed-time convex optimization (DPTCO) problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under undirected connected graph. A cascade design framework is proposed such that the DPTCO implementation is divided into two parts: distributed optimal trajectory generator design and local reference trajectory tracking controller design. The DPTCO problem is then transformed into the prescribed-time stabilization problem of a cascaded system. Changing Lyapunov function method and time-varying state transformation method together with the sufficient conditions are proposed to prove the prescribed-time stabilization of the cascaded system as well as the uniform boundedness of internal signals in the closed-loop systems. The proposed framework is then utilized to solve robust DPTCO problem for a class of chain-integrator MASs with external disturbances by constructing a novel variables and exploiting the property of time-varying gains. The proposed framework is further utilized to solve the adaptive DPTCO problem for a class of strict-feedback MASs with parameter uncertainty, in which backstepping method with prescribed-time dynamic filter is adopted. The descending power state transformation is introduced to compensate the growth of increasing rate induced by the derivative of time-varying gains in recursive steps and the high-order derivative of local reference trajectory is not required. Finally, theoretical results are verified by two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The Patchkeeper: An Integrated Wearable Electronic Stethoscope with Multiple Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many parts of human body generate internal sound during biological processes, which are rich sources of information for understanding health and wellbeing. Despite a long history of development and usage of stethoscopes, there is still a lack of proper tools for recording internal body sound together with complementary sensors for long term monitoring. In this paper, we show our development of a wearable electronic stethoscope, coined Patchkeeper (PK), that can be used for internal body sound recording over long periods of time. Patchkeeper also integrates several state-of-the-art biological sensors, including electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. As a wearable device, Patchkeeper can be placed on various parts of the body to collect sound from particular organs, including heart, lung, stomach, and joints etc. We show in this paper that several vital signals can be recorded simultaneously with high quality. As Patchkeeper can be operated directly by the user, e.g. without involving health care professionals, we believe it could be a useful tool for telemedicine and remote diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase coexistence in boundary-driven diffusive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-gas phase coexistence in a boundary-driven diffusive system is studied by analyzing fluctuating hydrodynamics of a density field defined on a one-dimensional lattice with a space interval $\Lambda$. When an interface width $\ell$ is much larger than $\Lambda$, the discrete model becomes the standard fluctuating hydrodynamics, where the phase coexistence condition is given by the local equilibrium thermodynamics. In contrast, when $\ell &lt; \Lambda$, the most probable density profile is determined by a new variational principle, where the chemical potential at the interface is found to deviate from the equilibrium coexistence chemical potential. This means that metastable states at equilibrium stably appear near the interface as the influence of the particle current. The variational function derived in the theoretical analysis is also found to be equivalent to the variational function formulated in an extended framework of thermodynamics called global thermodynamics. Finally, the validity of the theoretical result is confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes of neutron stars are an exciting prospect for analyzing the internal composition of NSs and studying matter at high densities. In this work, we focus on studying the $f$- and $p$- quadrupolar oscillation modes, which couple with gravitational waves. We construct two different equation of state ensembles, one without and one with a first-order phase transition, and examine how $f$- and $p$-modes might help us differentiate them. We find ensemble specific exclusion regions in the $65\%$ and $95\%$ confidence contours of the frequency-damping time relations. The exclusion regions become more prominent for the higher-order oscillation modes. However, these modes have higher frequencies, which are beyond the detection capabilities of present gravitational wave detectors. The quasi-universal relations of dimensionless quantities prove to be ineffective in differentiating the equation of state ensembles, as they obscure the details of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a nonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>CrowdMAC: Masked Crowd Density Completion for Robust Crowd Density Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crowd density forecasting task aims to predict how the crowd density map will change in the future from observed past crowd density maps. However, the past crowd density maps are often incomplete due to the miss-detection of pedestrians, and it is crucial to develop a robust crowd density forecasting model against the miss-detection. This paper presents a MAsked crowd density Completion framework for crowd density forecasting (CrowdMAC), which is simultaneously trained to forecast future crowd density maps from partially masked past crowd density maps (i.e., forecasting maps from past maps with miss-detection) while reconstructing the masked observation maps (i.e., imputing past maps with miss-detection). Additionally, we propose Temporal-Density-aware Masking (TDM), which non-uniformly masks tokens in the observed crowd density map, considering the sparsity of the crowd density maps and the informativeness of the subsequent frames for the forecasting task. Moreover, we introduce multi-task masking to enhance training efficiency. In the experiments, CrowdMAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven large-scale datasets, including SDD, ETH-UCY, inD, JRDB, VSCrowd, FDST, and croHD. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method against both synthetic and realistic miss-detections. The code is released at https://fujiry0.github.io/CrowdMAC-project-page.</description>

      <title>Generalization v.s. Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth. We also show the practical implications of our analysis through a novel prompt optimization algorithm.</description>

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and augmented reality. However, training 3D detectors requires a costly precise annotation, which is a hindrance to scaling annotation to large datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a weakly supervised 3D annotator that relies solely on 2D bounding box annotations from images, along with size priors. One major problem is that supervising a 3D detection model using only 2D boxes is not reliable due to ambiguities between different 3D poses and their identical 2D projection. We introduce a simple yet effective and generic solution: we build 3D proxy objects with annotations by construction and add them to the training dataset. Our method requires only size priors to adapt to new classes. To better align 2D supervision with 3D detection, our method ensures depth invariance with a novel expression of the 2D losses. Finally, to detect more challenging instances, our annotator follows an offline pseudo-labelling scheme which gradually improves its 3D pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method not only performs on-par or above previous works on the Car category, but also achieves performance close to fully supervised methods on more challenging classes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by being the first to experiment on the more challenging nuScenes dataset. We additionally propose a setting where weak labels are obtained from a 2D detector pre-trained on MS-COCO instead of human annotations.

      <title>How to Segment in 3D Using 2D Models: Automated 3D Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Metastatic Lesions on PET Volumes Using Multi-angle Maximum Intensity Projections and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging provides a tremendously exciting frontier in visualization of prostate cancer (PCa) metastatic lesions. However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</description>

      <title>Design Frictions on Social Media: Balancing Reduced Mindless Scrolling and User Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Design features of social media platforms, such as infinite scroll, increase users' likelihood of experiencing normative dissociation -- a mental state of absorption that diminishes self-awareness and disrupts memory. This paper investigates how adding design frictions into the interface of a social media platform reduce mindless scrolling and user satisfaction. We conducted a study with 30 participants and compared their memory recognition of posts in two scenarios: one where participants had to react to each post to access further content and another using an infinite scroll design. Participants who used the design frictions interface exhibited significantly better content recall, although a majority of participants found the interface frustrating. We discuss design recommendations and scenarios where adding design frictions to social media platforms can be beneficial.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group-Improved Gravitational Action: A Lagrangian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach to embedding the renormalization group running of Newton's constant and the cosmological constant in gravity is proposed. This approach is based on a gravitational Lagrangian that gives rise to a new class of modified gravity theories where $G$ and $\Lambda$ are spacetime-dependent functions. The Lagrangian formulation can be interpreted as an effective gravitational action that encapsulates the scale dependence of $G$, arising from quantum effects in the early universe. We show that the new formalism can be discussed in the framework of Horndeski modified gravity and apply to explore a non-singular cosmology featuring power-law inflation. In particular, we discuss the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations within this framework.</description>

      <title>Hug Reports: Supporting Expression of Appreciation between Users and Contributors of Open Source Software Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contributors to open source software packages often describe feeling discouraged by the lack of positive feedback from users. This paper describes a technology probe, Hug Reports, that provides users a communication affordance within their code editors, through which users can convey appreciation to contributors of packages they use. In our field study, 18 users interacted with the probe for 3 weeks, resulting in messages of appreciation to 550 contributors, 26 of whom participated in subsequent research. Our findings show how locating a communication affordance within the code editor, and allowing users to express appreciation in terms of the abstractions they are exposed to (packages, modules, functions), can support exchanges of appreciation that are meaningful to users and contributors. Findings also revealed the moments in which users expressed appreciation, the two meanings that appreciation took on -- as a measure of utility and as an act of expressive communication -- and how contributors' reactions to appreciation were influenced by their perceived level of contribution. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities and challenges for designing appreciation systems for open source in particular, and peer production communities more generally.</description>

      <title>Planar network statistics for two-dimensional rupturing foams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct experiments on a class of two-dimensional semiwet foams generated through compressing a three-dimensional soap foam between two glass plates. To induce a spatially uniform rupturing process on foam boundaries, an additional plate is heated and placed on top of the unheated plates. For 30 separate foam samples, we record network statistics related to cell side numbers and areas as the foam coarsens over a half-minute. We find that the Aboav law and a quadratic Lewis Law, two commonly used relations between network topology and geometry, hold well for preheated foams. To track how well these laws are maintained as the foam ages, we introduce metrics for measuring a foam's disorder over time and build simple autonomous models for these metrics. While the quadratic Lewis Law is found to hold well throughout the rupture process, the Aboav law breaks down rapidly when the Gini coefficient, used for measuring disparity of cell areas, is approximately 0.8.</description>

      <title>Hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks for rugged-energy-landscape spin glasses on periodic square and cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining the low-energy configurations of spin glasses that have rugged energy landscapes is of direct relevance to combinatorial optimization and fundamental science. Search-based heuristics have difficulty with this task due to the existence of many local minima that are far from optimal. The work of [M. M. Rams et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 025308 (2021)] demonstrates an alternative that can bypass this issue for spin glasses with planar or quasi-planar geometry: sampling the Boltzmann distribution via approximate contractions of tensor networks. The computational complexity of this approach is due only to the complexity of contracting the network, and is therefore independent of landscape ruggedness. Here we initiate an investigation of how to take this approach beyond (quasi-)planar geometry by utilizing hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks [J. Gray and G. K.-L. Chan, Phys. Rev. X 14, 011009 (2024)]. We perform tests on the periodic square- and cubic-lattice, planted-solution Ising spin glasses generated with tile planting [F. Hamze et al., Phys. Rev. E 97, 043303 (2018)] for up to 2304 (square lattice) and 216 (cubic lattice) spins. For a fixed bond dimension, the time complexity is quadratic. With a bond dimension of only four, over the tested system sizes the average relative energy error in the most rugged instance class remains at ~1% (square lattice) or ~10% (cubic lattice) of optimal. In less rugged instances the solution is always optimal for the square lattice and either optimal or within ~1% for the cubic lattice. These results suggest that further development of optimization methods based on tensor-network representations of spin glass partition functions may be fruitful, especially given that such methods are not limited to the Ising (i.e., binary) or two-body (i.e., quadratic) settings.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00939v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian observables for aligned-spin binaries to sixth order in spin from gravitational self-force and Compton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of compact binaries is essential for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation, with spin being an important effect to include in waveform models. In this paper, we derive new post-Newtonian (PN) results for the conservative aligned-spin dynamics at next-to-next-to-leading order for the spin$^3$ and spin$^4$ contributions, in addition to the next-to-leading order (NLO) spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ contributions. One approach we follow is the Tutti Frutti method, which relates PN and gravitational self-force results through the redshift and spin-precession invariants, by making use of the simple dependence of the scattering angle on the symmetric mass ratio. However, an ambiguity arises at the NLO spin$^5$ contribution, due to transcendental functions of the Kerr spin in the redshift; this is also the order at which Compton amplitudes calculations are affected by spurious poles. Therefore, we follow an additional approach to determine the NLO spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ dynamics: using on-shell Compton amplitudes obtained from black hole perturbation theory. The Compton amplitude used in this work is composed of the unambiguous tree-level far-zone part reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084071 (2024)], as well as the full, non-interfering with the far-zone, $\ell=2$ partial wave contributions from the near zone, which are responsible for capturing Kerr finite-size effects. Other results in this paper include deriving the scattering angle of a spinning test body in a Kerr background from a parametrized worldline action, and computing the redshift and spin-precession invariants for eccentric orbits without an eccentricity expansion.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hyperparameter space of deep neural network models for reaction coordinates: Revisiting the solvent coordinate in alanine dipeptide isomerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) from many collective variable candidates have been of great challenge in understanding reaction mechanisms in complex systems. Machine learning approaches, especially the deep neural network (DNN), have become a powerful tool in this field, and have actively been applied. On the other hand, the structure of the DNN model is highly flexible, and the hyperparameters that determine the structure is often selected intuitively or in a highly non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the choice of hyperparameter affects the quality of the DNN model remains obscure. In this work, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model in RC optimization, and investigate how the choice of parameter sets affect the quality of the RC. The DNN model is constructed from a large number of collective variables to predict the changes of committor along the RC by minimizing the cross-entropy function, and the hyperparameters are determined in an automatic manner using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with notably different structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy. Furthermore, despite the difference in the hyperparameters, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar, indicating that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. By studying the reaction in water, it is found that the electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen (H${}_{18}$), in addition to the dihedral angles $\phi$ and $\theta$, plays an important role in characterizing the RC. The DNN model thus effectively accounts for the torque character suggested previously.</description>

      <title>Probing the Effective Quantum Gravity via Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two quantum-corrected black hole models have recently been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraints approach to quantum gravity, maintaining general covariance \cite{Zhang:2024khj}. We have studied the quasinormal spectra of these black holes using four methods: the higher-order WKB approach with Pad\'e approximants, time-domain integration, Frobenius, and pseudospectral methods. The Frobenius method, in particular, allows us to determine precise values of the frequencies, including the overtones. The two models differ in their choice of quantum parameter $\xi$, and we can distinguish them by their quasinormal spectra. In the first model, increasing the quantum parameter results in higher real oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the fundamental mode. In contrast, the second model shows a decrease in the oscillation frequency of the least-damped mode when the quantum parameter is introduced. We have shown that, while the fundamental mode changes relatively gradually with the quantum parameter, the first few overtones deviate from their Schwarzschild limits at an increasing rate. This results in a qualitatively new behavior: the real parts of the frequencies of the first and higher overtones tend to zero as the quantum parameter increases. In addition to the branch of modes that are perturbative in the quantum parameter, we observe some non-perturbative modes at moderate values of the quantum parameter.
  Additionally, we have calculated the radii of the shadows cast by these black holes and discussed possible constraints based on observations of Sgt $A^*$. As a byproduct, we tested the method of calculating quasinormal modes of this kind based on a recent agnostic parametrization and showed that while the parametrized formalism could be used for estimating the fundamental mode at small values of the coupling, it is insufficient even for the lowest overtones.</description>

Abstract: We present a rapid stellar core-collapse waveform emulator built using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the Richers \textit{et al.~}\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the structure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and generate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of the training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces signals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early post-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The pre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.</description>

      <title>Interacting Models of Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the interacting models between the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field and the dark matter fluid in a homogeneous and isotropic background. A key feature of GB coupling models is the varying speed of gravitational waves (GWs). We utilize recent constraints on the GW speed and conduct our analysis in two primary scenarios: model-dependent and model-independent. In the model-dependent scenario, where determining the GW speed requires a specific GB coupling functional form, we choose an exponential GB coupling. We adopt a dynamical system analysis to obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters that describe different phases of the universe and produce a stable late-time accelerating solution following the GW constraint, and find that to satisfy all these constraints, fine-tuning of the free parameters involved in the models is often needed. In the model-independent scenario, the GW speed is fixed to one, and we construct the autonomous system to identify the late-time stable accelerating critical points. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian inference method using late-time observational data sets, including 31 data points from cosmic chronometer data (Hubble data) and 1701 data points from Pantheon+ and find that all the observational constraints can be satisfied without fine-tuning. In addition, we also utilize simulated binned Roman and LSST data to study the evolution of the universe in the model-independent scenario. We find that the model shows significant deviation at higher redshifts from $\Lambda$CDM and fits the current data much better than $\Lambda$CDM within the error bars.</description>

      <title>Charged pions asymmetry from the decay of light neutral axial mesons due to interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective three meson couplings, based in flavor U(3) quark-antiquark interactions, are considered to describe two light neutral axial meson Strong decays, $A \sim f_1(1285)$ and $f_{1S} (1420)$, and the charged rho meson decay in the following channels: $A \to \rho^\mp (770)+ \pi^\pm$, $A\to a_0^\mp (980) +\pi^\pm$ and $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. By considering neutral meson mixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and $\eta-\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson interactions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a resulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions, $\Gamma_{\pi^+}/\Gamma_{\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be assumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons undergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other inelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.</description>

      <title>3D-free meets 3D priors: Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image with Pretrained Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods often require extensive 3D data for training, and also typically lack generalization beyond the training distribution. Moreover, they tend to be object centric and struggle with complex and intricate scenes. Conversely, 3D-free methods can generate text-controlled views of complex, in-the-wild scenes using a pretrained stable diffusion model without the need for a large amount of 3D-based training data, but lack camera control. In this paper, we introduce a method capable of generating camera-controlled viewpoints from a single input image, by combining the benefits of 3D-free and 3D-based approaches. Our method excels in handling complex and diverse scenes without extensive training or additional 3D and multiview data. It leverages widely available pretrained NVS models for weak guidance, integrating this knowledge into a 3D-free view synthesis style approach, along with enriching the CLIP vision-language space with 3D camera angle information, to achieve the desired results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, achieving high-fidelity, consistent novel view synthesis at desired camera angles across a wide variety of scenes while maintaining accurate, natural detail representation and image clarity across various viewpoints. We also support our method with a comprehensive analysis of 2D image generation models and the 3D space, providing a solid foundation and rationale for our solution.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Theory Remixed II: Improved Modeling of Nonlinear Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the application of the $n$-th order Eulerian Perturbation Theory ($n$EPT) for modeling the matter bispectrum in real space as an advancement over the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT). The $n$EPT method, detailed in Wang et al. (2023) \cite{Wang2023nEPT}, sums up the density perturbations up to the $n$-th order before computing summary statistics such as bispectrum. Taking advantage of grid-based calculation of SPT (GridSPT), we make a realization-based comparison of the analytical nonlinear bispectrum predictions from $n$EPT and SPT against a suite of $N$-body simulations. Using a spherical-bispectrum visualization scheme, we show that $n$EPT bispectrum matches better than SPT bispectrum over a wide range of scales in general $w$CDM cosmologies. Like the power spectrum case, we find that $n$EPT bispectrum modeling accuracy is controlled by $\sigma_8(z) \equiv \sigma_8 D(z)$, where $D(z)$ is the linear growth factor at a redshift $z$. Notably, the 6EPT doubles the bispectrum model's validity range compared to the one-loop SPT for $\sigma_8(z) &lt; 0.5$, corresponding to redshifts $z\ge1$ for the best-fitting Planck-2018 cosmology. For $n\ge5$, however, $n$EPT bispectrum depends sensitively on the cut-off scale or the grid resolution. The percent-level modeling accuracy achieved for the spherical bispectrum (where we average over all triangular configurations) becomes much degraded when fixing configurations. Thus, we show that the validity range of the field-level cosmological inferences must be different from that derived from averaged summary statistics such as $n$-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Modeling Errors on Distributed Continuous-time Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>DataVisT5: A Pre-trained Language Model for Jointly Understanding Text and Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data visualization (DV) is the fundamental and premise tool to improve the efficiency in conveying the insights behind the big data, which has been widely accepted in existing data-driven world. Task automation in DV, such as converting natural language queries to visualizations (i.e., text-to-vis), generating explanations from visualizations (i.e., vis-to-text), answering DV-related questions in free form (i.e. FeVisQA), and explicating tabular data (i.e., table-to-text), is vital for advancing the field. Despite their potential, the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like T5 and BERT in DV has been limited by high costs and challenges in handling cross-modal information, leading to few studies on PLMs for DV. We introduce DataVisT5, a novel PLM tailored for DV that enhances the T5 architecture through a hybrid objective pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning strategy, integrating text and DV datasets to effectively interpret cross-modal semantics. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that DataVisT5 consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models on various DV-related tasks. We anticipate that DataVisT5 will not only inspire further research on vertical PLMs but also expand the range of applications for PLMs.</description>

      <title>On embedding separable spaces $\mathcal{C}(L)$ in arbitrary spaces $\mathcal{C}(K)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supplementing and expanding classical results, for compact spaces $K$ and $L$, $L$ metric, and their Banach spaces $\mathcal{C}(L)$ and $\mathcal{C}(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions, we provide several characterizations of the existence of isometric, resp. isomorphic, embeddings of $\mathcal{C}(L)$ into $\mathcal{C}(K)$. In particular, we show that if the embedded space $\mathcal{C}(L)$ is separable, then the classical theorems of Holszty\'{n}ski and Gordon become equivalences.
  We also obtain new results describing the relative cellularities of the perfect kernel of a given compact space $K$ and of the Cantor--Bendixson derived sets of $K$ of countable order in terms of the presence of isometric copies of specific spaces $\mathcal{C}(L)$ inside $\mathcal{C}(K)$.</description>

      <title>Tree species classification at the pixel-level using deep learning and multispectral time series in an imbalanced context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates tree species classification using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite image time-series. Despite their critical importance for many applications, such maps are often unavailable, outdated, or inaccurate for large areas. The interest of using remote sensing time series to produce these maps has been highlighted in many studies. However, many methods proposed in the literature still rely on a standard classification algorithm, usually the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with vegetation indices. This study shows that the use of deep learning models can lead to a significant improvement in classification results, especially in an imbalanced context where the RF algorithm tends to predict towards the majority class. In our use case in the center of France with 10 tree species, we obtain an overall accuracy (OA) around 95% and a F1-macro score around 80% using three different benchmark deep learning architectures. In contrast, using the RF algorithm yields an OA of 93% and an F1 of 60%, indicating that the minority classes are not classified with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, the proposed framework is a strong baseline that can be easily implemented in most scenarios, even with a limited amount of reference data. Our results highlight that standard multilayer perceptron can be competitive with batch normalization and a sufficient amount of parameters. Other architectures (convolutional or attention-based) can also achieve strong results when tuned properly. Furthermore, our results show that DL models are naturally robust to imbalanced data, although similar results can be obtained using dedicated techniques.</description>

      <title>Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Single-cell Curriculum Learning-based Deep Graph Embedding Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-criteria (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code of scCLG will be made publicly available at https://github.com/LFD-byte/scCLG.</description>

      <title>Integrating Multi-Modal Input Token Mixer Into Mamba-Based Decision Models: Decision MetaMamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence modeling with State Space models (SSMs) has demonstrated performance surpassing that of Transformers in various tasks, raising expectations for their potential to outperform the Decision Transformer and its enhanced variants in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself. This novel modification to Mamba's input layer represents a departure from conventional timestamp-based encoding approaches used in Transformers. By enhancing performance of Mamba in offline RL, characterized by memory efficiency and fast inference, this work opens new avenues for its broader application in future RL research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11321v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal chemical interaction between silicate and overlying hydrogen-rich envelopes for rocky planets using basic tenets of phase equilibria. Based on our current understanding of the temperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and hydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the nature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of supercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As a result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere interfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the thermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus influence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of sub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal in silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Could ChatGPT get an Engineering Degree? Evaluating Higher Education Vulnerability to AI Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI assistants are being increasingly used by students enrolled in higher education institutions. While these tools provide opportunities for improved teaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment and learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of vulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes to be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential scale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can complete assessment questions in standard university-level STEM courses. Specifically, we compile a novel dataset of textual assessment questions from 50 courses at EPFL and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to produce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions correctly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one prompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset by degree program, these systems already pass non-project assessments of large numbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher education accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve. Our results call for revising program-level assessment design in higher education in light of advances in generative AI.</description>

      <title>X650-&gt;ZZ/WW/H125H95/A450Z -- scalar, tensor or both ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a spin 2 resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A420Z could come from a H650 resonance degenerate in mass with T650. We propose a scheme in which scalar resonances are accommodated in three doublets, T650 in an isosinglet, T450++, T375+ and T350 belong to an isofiveplet.</description>

      <title>Image Segmentation in Foundation Model Era: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems. A public website is created to continuously track developments in this fast advancing field: \url{https://github.com/stanley-313/ImageSegFM-Survey}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13292v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a differential topological proof and an analytical proof of Riemann hypothesis according to the saddle point method because Riemann calculated the integral representation of zeta function on the critical line by this method. This topological proof of RH proves that the existence of integral representation of zeta functions requires certain differential topological conditions on its integrand according to which the zeta function vanishes on the critical line. The analytical proof of RH is the local implementation of topological proof or its coordinate representation.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum-Mechanical Evolutions from Probability Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions connecting arbitrary source and a target states on the Bloch sphere equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. This investigation is performed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\"odinger quantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical trajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from a classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric complexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only partial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic quantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the complexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity length scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both quantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e., total) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the quantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Third, after calculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one of the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with that of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions are less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that complexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent can exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a smaller curvature coefficient.</description>

      <title>An MLE-based analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to explore factorization and event-plane correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly available data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for various centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional methodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods. Leveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant because of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order correlators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the MLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique capabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically inaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>MROVSeg: Breaking the Resolution Curse of Vision-Language Models in Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), \eg CLIP, are increasingly used to bridge the gap between open- and close-vocabulary recognition in open-vocabulary image segmentation. As VLMs are generally pretrained with low-resolution images (e.g. $224\times224$), most previous methods operate only on downscaled images. We question this design as low resolution features often fail to preserve fine details. A typical solution is to employ additional image backbones for high-resolution inputs, but it also introduce significant computation overhead. Therefore, we propose MROVSeg, a multi-resolution training framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation with a single pretrained CLIP backbone, that uses sliding windows to slice the high-resolution input into uniform patches, each matching the input size of the well-trained image encoder. Its key components include a Multi-Res Adapter, which restores the spatial geometry and grasps local-global correspondences across patches by interacting with multi-resolution features. To achieve accurate segmentation, we introduce Multi-grained Masked Attention scheme to aggregate multi-grained semantics from multi-resolution CLIP features to object queries. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of MROVSeg on well-established open-vocabulary image segmentation benchmarks, establishing new standards for open-vocabulary image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Orbital integrals and ideal class monoids for a Bass order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bass order is an order of a number field whose fractional ideals are generated by two elements. Majority of number fields contain infinitely many Bass orders. For example, any order of a number field which contains the maximal order of a subfield with degree 2 or whose discriminant is 4th-power-free in $\mathbb{Z}$, is a Bass order.
  In this paper, we will propose a closed formula for the number of fractional ideals of a Bass order $R$, up to its invertible ideals, using the conductor of $R$. We will also explain explicit enumeration of all orders containing $R$. Our method is based on local global argument and exhaustion argument, by using orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ as a mass formula.</description>

      <title>Seeking the Sufficiency and Necessity Causal Features in Multimodal Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) measures the likelihood of a feature set being both necessary and sufficient for predicting an outcome. It has proven effective in guiding representation learning for unimodal data, enhancing both predictive performance and model robustness. Despite these benefits, extending PNS to multimodal settings remains unexplored. This extension presents unique challenges, as the conditions for PNS estimation, exogeneity and monotonicity, need to be reconsidered in a multimodal context. We address these challenges by first conceptualizing multimodal representations as comprising modality-invariant and modality-specific components. We then analyze how to compute PNS for each component while ensuring non-trivial PNS estimation. Based on these analyses, we formulate tractable optimization objectives that enable multimodal models to learn high-PNS representations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Activation of momentum fluctuations in wave packet molecular dynamics: Impacts on momentum distributions of projectilelike fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics approaches use wave packets as nucleon wave functions to simulate the time evolution of nuclear reactions. It is crucial to activate the momentum fluctuation inherent in each wave packet so that it properly affects the time evolution. In the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, this has traditionally been done by splitting the wave packets, i.e., by introducing a random fluctuation to the wave packet center of each particle. The present work proposes an improved approach to activate the fluctuation in both the one-body mean-field propagation and the two-nucleon collision processes, consistently based on the gradual or sudden change of the degree of isolation, which is derived from the fragment number function used for the zero-point energy subtraction. This new method is applied to the 12C + 12C and 12C + p reactions at about 100 MeV/nucleon, focusing on the momentum distribution of the 11B fragments produced by one-proton removal from the 12C projectile. The results show that, with the momentum fluctuation suitably activated, the method correctly accounts for the recoil from the removed nucleon to the residue and the 11B momentum distribution is significantly improved, while without activating the fluctuation the distribution is too narrow compared to the experimental data. Furthermore, the AMD results indicate that the momentum distribution consists of two components; one is the high $P_z$ component with a small shift from the beam velocity, resulting from the simple removal of a proton after an energetic collision with a target particle; the other is the low $P_z$ component with a larger peak shift resulting from the decay of an excited 12C nucleus in a longer time scale. The activation of momentum fluctuation mainly affects the high $P_z$ component to broaden it. The role of cluster correlations in this problem is also investigated.</description>

Abstract: We report the crystal structures and superconductivity (SC) of LaPt$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$ ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1.0$) that are solid solutions of LaSi$_{2}$ and LaPtSi with centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}/amd$, $D_{4h}^{19}$, \#141) and non-centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}md$, $C_{4v}^{11}$, \#109) structures, respectively. It was found that at $0.86 \leq x \leq 1.00$, the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal symmetry is preserved, while partial disorder appears in alternating Pt and Si of the hyper-honeycomb network. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ was drastically reduced from 3.9 K to 1.5 K as $x$ varies from 1.0 to 0.86. Additionally, a hexagonal phase with an AlB$_{2}$-type structure ($P6/mmm$, $D_{6h}^{1}$, \#191) has been discovered at $0.50 \leq x \leq 0.71$ with a honeycomb network of statistically distributed Pt and Si atoms. The hexagonal phase exhibited SC at $T_{\rm c} = 0.38$ K. This system provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between topological electronic states, SC, and disorders</description>

      <title>Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)</description>

      <title>Tournament transitivity of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \textit{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$ in $G$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{tournament transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$ and $V_j$ does not dominate $V_i$ for $i&lt;j$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is called \emph{tournament transitivity} of $G$, and it is denoted by $TTr(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Tournament Transitivity Problem} is to find a tournament transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. In this article, we study this variation of transitive partition from a structure and algorithmic point of view. We show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for chordal graphs (connected), perfect elimination bipartite graphs (disconnected) and doubly chordal graphs (disconnected). On the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for trees. Furthermore, we characterize \textup{Type-I BCG} with equal transitivity and tournament transitivity and find some sufficient conditions under which the above two parameters are equal for a \textup{Type-II BCG}. Finally, we show that for \textup{Type-III BCG}, these two parameters are never equal.</description>

Abstract: China accounts for one-third of the world's total carbon emissions. How to reach the peak of carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 to ensure the effective realization of the "dual-carbon" target is an important policy orientation at present. Based on the provincial panel data of ARIMA-BP model, this paper shows that the effect of energy consumption intensity effect is the main factor driving the growth of carbon emissions, per capita GDP and energy consumption structure effect are the main factors to inhibit carbon emissions, and the effect of industrial structure and population size effect is relatively small. Based on the research conclusion, the policy suggestions are put forward from the aspects of energy structure, industrial structure, new quality productivity and digital economy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of module categories in the infinite and non-rigid settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By building on the notions of internal projective and injective objects in a module category introduced by Douglas, Schommer-Pries, and Snyder, we extend the reconstruction theory for module categories of Etingof and Ostrik. More explicitly, instead of algebra objects in finite tensor categories, we consider quasi-finite coalgebra objects in locally finite tensor categories. Moreover, we show that module categories over non-rigid monoidal categories can be reconstructed via lax module monads, which generalize algebra objects. For the monoidal category of finite-dimensional comodules over a (non-Hopf) bialgebra, we give this result a more concrete form, realizing module categories as categories of contramodules over Hopf trimodule algebras -- this specializes to our tensor-categorical results in the Hopf case. In this context, we also give a precise Morita theorem, as well as an analogue of the Eilenberg--Watts theorem for lax module monads and, as a consequence, for Hopf trimodule algebras. Using lax module functors we give a categorical proof of the variant of the fundamental theorem of Hopf modules which applies to Hopf trimodules. We also give a characterization of fusion operators for a Hopf monad as coherence cells for a module functor structure, using which we similarly reinterpret and reprove the Hopf-monadic fundamental theorem of Hopf modules due to Brugui\`eres, Lack, and Virelizier.</description>

      <title>ComfyBench: Benchmarking LLM-based Agents in ComfyUI for Autonomously Designing Collaborative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this work attempts to study using LLM-based agents to design collaborative AI systems autonomously. To explore this problem, we first introduce ComfyBench to evaluate agents's ability to design collaborative AI systems in ComfyUI. ComfyBench is a comprehensive benchmark comprising 200 diverse tasks covering various instruction-following generation challenges, along with detailed annotations for 3,205 nodes and 20 workflows. Based on ComfyBench, we further develop ComfyAgent, a novel framework that empowers LLM-based agents to autonomously design collaborative AI systems by generating workflows. ComfyAgent is based on two core concepts. First, it represents workflows with code, which can be reversibly converted into workflows and executed as collaborative systems by the interpreter. Second, it constructs a multi-agent system that cooperates to learn from existing workflows and generate new workflows for a given task. While experimental results demonstrate that ComfyAgent achieves a comparable resolve rate to o1-preview and significantly surpasses other agents on ComfyBench, ComfyAgent has resolved only 15\% of creative tasks. LLM-based agents still have a long way to go in autonomously designing collaborative AI systems. Progress with ComfyBench is paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous collaborative AI systems.</description>

      <title>Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4151 during Outburst Stage. II. Four Season Observation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a four-year velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of the changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 4151 during its outburst phase. By measuring the time lags of the \ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii\ emission lines, we confirm a stratified broad-line region (BLR) structure that aligns with predictions from photoionization models. Intriguingly, we observed an ``anti-breathing" phenomenon, where the lags of broad emission lines decreased with increasing luminosity, contrary to the typical expectation. This anomaly may be attributed to the influence of the ultraviolet-optical lag or non-virialized motions in the BLR gas. Velocity-resolved RM and ionization mapping analyses revealed rapid and significant changes in the BLR geometry and kinematics on timescales within one year, which cannot be interpreted by any single mechanism, such as an inhomogeneous BLR, variations in radiation pressure, or changes in the illuminated ionizing field. Additionally, the \hb\ lags of NGC 4151 and other CL-AGNs agree with the radius-luminosity relationship established for AGNs with low accretion rates, implying that the CL phenomenon is more likely driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion rate rather than obscuration. These findings provide new insights into the complex internal processes of CL-AGNs and highlight the importance of long-term, multi-line RM for understanding BLR structures, geometry, and kinematics.</description>

      <title>From Yes-Men to Truth-Tellers: Addressing Sycophancy in Large Language Models with Pinpoint Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to prioritize adherence to user prompts over providing veracious responses, leading to the sycophancy issue. When challenged by users, LLMs tend to admit mistakes and provide inaccurate responses even if they initially provided the correct answer. Recent works propose to employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to mitigate the sycophancy issue, while it typically leads to the degeneration of LLMs' general capability. To address the challenge, we propose a novel supervised pinpoint tuning (SPT), where the region-of-interest modules are tuned for a given objective. Specifically, SPT first reveals and verifies a small percentage (&lt;5%) of the basic modules, which significantly affect a particular behavior of LLMs. i.e., sycophancy. Subsequently, SPT merely fine-tunes these identified modules while freezing the rest. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPT, we conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that SPT significantly mitigates the sycophancy issue of LLMs (even better than SFT). Moreover, SPT introduces limited or even no side effects on the general capability of LLMs. Our results shed light on how to precisely, effectively, and efficiently explain and improve the targeted ability of LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Local map construction is a vital component of intelligent driving perception, offering necessary reference for vehicle positioning and planning. Standard Definition map (SDMap), known for its low cost, accessibility, and versatility, has significant potential as prior information for local map perception. This paper mainly reviews the local map construction methods with SDMap, including definitions, general processing flow, and datasets. Besides, this paper analyzes multimodal data representation and fusion methods in SDMap-based local map construction. This paper also discusses key challenges and future directions, such as optimizing SDMap processing, enhancing spatial alignment with real-time data, and incorporating richer environmental information. At last, the review looks forward to future research focusing on enhancing road topology inference and multimodal data fusion to improve the robustness and scalability of local map perception.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent approach to the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in multichromophoric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally tractable and reliable, albeit approximate, methods for studying exciton transport in molecular aggregates immersed in structured bosonic environments have been actively developed. Going beyond the lowest-order (Born) approximation for the memory kernel of the quantum master equation typically results in complicated and possibly divergent expressions. Starting from the memory kernel in the Born approximation, and recognizing the quantum master equation as the Dyson equation of Green's functions theory, we formulate the self-consistent Born approximation to resum the memory-kernel perturbation series in powers of the exciton--environment interaction. Our formulation is in the Liouville space and frequency domain and handles arbitrary exciton--environment spectral densities. In a molecular dimer coupled to an overdamped oscillator environment, we conclude that the self-consistent cycle significantly improves the Born-approximation energy-transfer dynamics. The dynamics in the self-consistent Born approximation agree well with the solutions of hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters, including the most challenging regimes of strong exciton--environment interactions, slow environments, and low temperatures. This is rationalized by the analytical considerations of coherence-dephasing dynamics in the pure-dephasing model. We find that the self-consistent Born approximation is good (poor) at describing energy transfer modulated by an underdamped vibration resonant (off-resonant) with the exciton energy gap. Nevertheless, it reasonably describes exciton dynamics in the seven-site model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex in a realistic environment comprising both an overdamped continuum and underdamped vibrations.</description>

Abstract: Semi-holography, originally proposed as a model for conducting lattice electrons coupled to a holographic critical sector, leads to an effective theory of non-Fermi liquids with only a few relevant interactions on the Fermi surface in the large $N$ limit. A refined version of such theories has only two effective couplings which give holographic and Fermi-liquid-like contributions to the self-energy, respectively. We show that a low co-dimension sub-manifold exists in the space of refined semi-holographic theories in which strange metallic behavior is manifested, and which can be obtained just by tuning the ratio of the two couplings. On this sub-manifold, the product of the spectral function and the temperature is approximately independent of the critical exponent, the Fermi energy, and the temperature at all frequencies and near the Fermi surface when expressed in terms of suitably scaled momentum and frequency variables. This quasi-universal behavior leads to linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity and Planckian dissipation over a large range of temperatures, and we also obtain $T^{-3}$ scaling of the Hall conductivity at higher temperatures. The quasi-universal spectral function also fits well with photoemission spectroscopic data without varying the critical exponent with the doping. Combining with the results for optical conductivity, we construct a generalized version of Drude phenomenology for strange-metallic behavior which satisfies non-trivial consistency tests. Finally, we discuss a possible dynamical mechanism for the fine-tuning of the ratio of the two couplings necessary to realize the strange metallic behavior in a typical state.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Density Matrices via Dense Dual Bases</title>

Abstract: Efficient understanding of a quantum system fundamentally relies on the selection of observables. Pauli observables and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are widely used in practice and are often regarded as theoretically optimal for quantum state tomography (QST). However, Pauli observables require a large number of measurements for full-state tomography and do not permit direct measurement of density matrix elements with a constant number of observables. For MUBs, the existence of complete sets of \(d+1\) bases in all dimensions remains unresolved, highlighting the need for alternative observables. In this work, we introduce Dense Dual Bases (DDB), a novel set of \(2d\) observables specifically designed to enable the complete characterization of any \(d\)-dimensional quantum state. These observables offer two key advantages. First, they enable direct measurement of density matrix elements without auxiliary systems, allowing any element to be extracted using only three selected observables. Second, QST for unknown rank-\(r\) density matrices--excluding only a negligible subset--can be achieved with \(O(r \log d)\) observables, significantly improving measurement efficiency. As for circuit implementation, each observable is iteratively generated and can be efficiently decomposed into \(O(n^4)\) elementary gates for an \(n\)-qubit system. These advances establish DDB as a practical and scalable alternative to traditional methods, offering promising opportunities to advance the efficiency and scalability of quantum system characterization.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analysis for Assisted Diagnosis of Vocal Fold Paralysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analyzing System (MLVAS), a novel system that leverages both audio and video data to automatically extract key segments and metrics from raw laryngeal videostroboscopic videos for assisted clinical assessment. The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Additionally, MLVAS features an advanced strobing video extraction module that specifically identifies strobing frames from laryngeal videostroboscopy by analyzing hue, saturation, and value fluctuations. Beyond key segment extraction, MLVAS provides effective metrics for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. It employs a novel two-stage glottis segmentation process using a U-Net for initial segmentation, followed by a diffusion-based refinement to reduce false positives, providing better segmentation masks for downstream tasks. MLVAS estimates the vibration dynamics for both left and right vocal folds from the segmented glottis masks to detect unilateral VFP by measuring the angle deviation with the estimated glottal midline. Comparing the variance between left's and right's dynamics, the system effectively distinguishes between left and right VFP. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory (FTPFT) in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: (i) they are integrable via mapping to a second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; and (ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases), it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of FTPFT based on Wigner transforms (WTs) of projected functions, we show how to: (i) calculate the basic ``bubble'' diagram in the Loschmidt echo (LE) of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; and (ii) resum the generalized Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion two-point retarded functions in the ``bubble'' diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of LE for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analyticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that stable, freely suspended liquid crystal films can be made from the ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N_F}$) phase and from the recently discovered polar, lamellar $\mathrm{SmZ_A}$ and $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ phases. The $\mathrm{N_F}$ films display two-dimensional, smectic-like parabolic focal conic textures comprising director/polarization bend that are a manifestation of the electrostatic suppression of director splay in the film plane. In the $\mathrm{SmZ_A}$ and $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ phases, the smectic layers orient preferentially normal to the film surfaces, a condition never found in typical thermotropic or lyotropic lamellar LC phases, with the $\mathrm{SmZ_A}$ films exhibiting focal-conic fan textures mimicking the appearance of typical smectics in glass cells when the layers are oriented normal to the plates, and the $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ films showing a texture of plaquettes of uniform in-plane orientation where both bend and splay are suppressed, separated by grain boundaries. The $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ phase can also be drawn into thin filaments, in which X-ray scattering reveals that the smectic layer planes are normal to the filament axis. Remarkably, the filaments are mechanically stable even if they break, forming free-standing, fluid filaments supported only at one end. The unique architectures of these films and filaments are stabilized by the electrostatic self-interaction of the liquid crystal polarization field, which enables the formation of confined, fluid structures that are fundamentally different from those of their counterparts made using previously known liquid crystal phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Use Model Averaging instead of Model Selection in Pulsar Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analyzed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as ``circular analysis.'' This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to Log-Uniform priors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction in nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length scales all the way down to 1 nm. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Helical randomization of magnetized Galactic and galaxy clusters plasmas: from magnetorotational disc dynamo to the Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission skies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and Galactic and galaxy clusters observations, it is shown that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the Galactic and galaxy clusters magnetized plasmas occurs via a randomization process. The notion of distributed chaos has been used to describe the randomization process. The randomization can be quantified with the main parameter of the distributed chaos, which in turn can be related to magnetic helicity or its dissipation rate. Spontaneous breaking of local reflectional symmetry (an intrinsic property of chaotic/turbulent motions) generates local helicity even when the global helicity is negligible. It is shown that the magnetic fields can impose their level of randomization on the electron density, Faraday rotation maps, and synchrotron emission. Results of the numerical simulations of the Galactic and galaxy clusters dynamos: the inner disk's ones (based on the magnetorotational instability) and global ones, are in good agreement with this approach, as well as with the results obtained using observations of the Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission skies.</description>

      <title>A Suite for Acoustic Language Model Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech language models have recently demonstrated great potential as universal speech processing systems. Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc. Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking. To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response. The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text. We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones. This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models. We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method. We make the code and data publicly available at https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/ .</description>

      <title>Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Gas-Rich Galaxies at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope confirm the existence of massive black holes ($&gt;10^6$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) beyond the redshift of $z=10$. However, their formation mechanism(s) still remain an open question. Light seed black holes are one such formation pathway, forming as the end stage of metalfree (Population III) stars. Light seed black holes can grow into massive black holes as long as they accrete near the Eddington limit for substantial periods or undergo several bursts of super-Eddington accretion. In this work, our aim is to ascertain if light seeds can grow in gas rich galaxies - similar to those expected at high redshift (z $\gtrsim 10$). Using the Arepo code, we follow self-consistently the formation of Population III stars and black holes in galaxies with total masses in the range $10^8$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We find that in the absence of feedback, black holes can grow to $10^5$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in just $10^4$ years. These black holes do not decouple from the gas clumps in which they are born and are able to accrete at hyper-Eddington rates. In the presence of supernova feedback, the number of actively growing black holes diminishes by an order of magnitude. However, we still observe hyper-Eddington accretion in approximately 1 % of the black hole population despite supernova feedback. This (idealised) work lays the foundation for future works, where we will test our models in a cosmological framework. In this work, we neglect radiative feedback processes from stellar evolution and from accretion onto the growing black holes. This likely means that our results represent an upper limit to light seed growth. We will address these shortcomings in future work.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>

Abstract: We provide the first counterexample showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This convexity has been conjectured for decades and plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counterexample involves six nuclei with small fractional charges placed far apart. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is shown to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. We also show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. This article raises the question of whether the energy convexity really holds for all possible molecules (with nuclei of integer charge).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a truth universally acknowledged, that space charge effects in ultrarelativistic electron storage rings are irrelevant due to the steep inverse dependence of their strength on the Lorentz factor. Yet, with the push towards the diffraction limit, the state-of-the-art light sources are approaching the point where their emittance becomes so small that the space charge force can no longer be ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate how space charge effects affect the injection dynamics, dynamical aperture, and collective beam stability on the example of 4th generation light sources PETRA IV and SOLEIL II.</description>

Abstract: We characterize rotund, uniformly rotund, locally uniformly rotund and compactly locally uniformly rotund spaces in terms of sets of (almost) farthest points from the unit sphere using the generalized diameter. For this we introduce few remotality properties using the sets of almost farthest points. As a consequence, we obtain some characterizations of the aforementioned rotundity properties in terms of existing proximinality notions.</description>

Abstract: Some problems in the theory and applications of stochastic processes can be reduced to solving integral equations. While explicit solutions for these equations are often elusive, valuable insights can be gained through their asymptotic analysis with respect to relevant parameters. This paper is a brief survey of some recent progress in the study of such equations related to processes with fractional covariance structure.</description>

Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

      <title>Poisson and Gamma Model Marginalisation and Marginal Likelihood calculation using Moment-generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new analytical method to derive the likelihood function that has the population of parameters marginalised out in Bayesian hierarchical models. This method is also useful to find the marginal likelihoods in Bayesian models or in random-effect linear mixed models. The key to this method is to take high-order (sometimes fractional) derivatives of the prior moment-generating function if particular existence and differentiability conditions hold.
  In particular, this analytical method assumes that the likelihood is either Poisson or gamma. Under Poisson likelihoods, the observed Poisson count determines the order of the derivative. Under gamma likelihoods, the shape parameter, which is assumed to be known, determines the order of the fractional derivative.
  We also present some examples validating this new analytical method.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 157 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present, analyze, and illustrate a first-of-its-kind model of two-dimensional excitable (spiking) dynamics for decision-making over two options. The model, Spiking Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (S-NOD), provides superior agility, characterized by fast, flexible, and adaptive response to rapid and unpredictable changes in context, environment, or information received about available options. S-NOD derives through the introduction of a single extra term to the previously presented Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD) for fast and flexible multi-agent decision-making behavior. The extra term is inspired by the fast-positive, slow-negative mixed-feedback structure of excitable systems. The agile behaviors brought about by the new excitable nature of decision-making driven by S-NOD are analyzed in a general setting and illustrated in an application to multi-robot navigation around human movers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in both music generation and music source separation tasks. Although in early stages, a trend is emerging towards integrating these tasks into a single framework, as both involve generating musically aligned parts and can be seen as facets of the same generative process. In this work, we introduce a latent diffusion-based multi-track generation model capable of both source separation and multi-track music synthesis by learning the joint probability distribution of tracks sharing a musical context. Our model also enables arrangement generation by creating any subset of tracks given the others. We trained our model on the Slakh2100 dataset, compared it with an existing simultaneous generation and separation model, and observed significant improvements across objective metrics for source separation, music, and arrangement generation tasks. Sound examples are available at https://msg-ld.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear opinion dynamics model for an agent making decisions about a continuous distribution of options in the presence of input. Inspired by perceptual decision-making, we develop new theory for opinion formation in response to inputs about options distributed on the circle. Options on the circle can represent, e.g., the possible directions of perceived objects and resulting heading directions in planar robotic navigation problems. Interactions among options are encoded through a spatially invariant kernel, which we design to ensure that only a small (finite) subset of options can be favored over the continuum. We leverage the spatial invariance of the model linearization to design flexible, distributed opinion-forming behaviors using spatiotemporal frequency domain and bifurcation analysis. We illustrate our model's versatility with an application to robotic navigation in crowded spaces.</description>

      <title>Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent study, Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)] proposed a universal classification scheme that interprets black hole solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space, and then divides black hole solutions into four distinct classes, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$, offering insights into deeper aspects of black hole thermodynamics and gravity. In this paper, we investigate the universal thermodynamic topological classification of the singly rotating Kerr black holes in all dimensions, as well as the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole. We show that the innermost small black hole states of the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically unstable, while those of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, the outermost large black holes exhibit unstable behavior in all these cases. At the low-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have one large thermodynamically unstable black hole, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes feature one large unstable branch and one small stable branch. Conversely, at the high-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes exhibit a small unstable black hole state, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have no black hole states at all. Consequently, we demonstrate that the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{1-}$, whereas the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman and $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{0+}$, thereby further support the conjecture proposed in [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)].</description>

      <title>MMSearch: Benchmarking the Potential of Large Models as Multi-modal Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine. Project Page: https://mmsearch.github.io</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Knowledge Pruning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Benchmark and Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs) through the integration of external knowledge. While numerous efforts, most studies focus on a single type of externeal knowledge source. However, in real-world applications, most situations involve diverse knowledge from various sources, yet this area has been less explored. The main dilemma is the lack of a suitable dataset containing multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark dataset that combines structured and unstructured knowledge across diverse and complementary domains. Based on this dataset, we further develop a plug-and-play RAG framework, PruningRAG, whose main characteristic is to employ multi-granularity pruning strategies for optimizing the integration of relevant information and minimizing misleading context. Building upon the standardized dataset and PruningRAG, we also report a series of experimental results, as well as insightful findings. Our dataset and code are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/USTCAGI/PruningRAG}, with the aim of advancing future research in the RAG community.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Large and Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a massively parallel, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the calculation of the vertical excitation energies (VEEs) and optical absorption spectra of condensed and molecular systems, starting from single-particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained with density functional theory. The algorithms adopted here circumvent the slowly converging sums over empty and occupied states and the inversion of large dielectric matrices, through a density matrix perturbation theory approach and a low-rank decomposition of the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively. Further computational savings are achieved by exploiting the nearsightedness of the density matrix of semiconductors and insulators to reduce the number of screened Coulomb integrals. We scale our calculations to thousands of GPUs with a hierarchical loop and data distribution strategy. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated by computing the VEEs of several spin defects in wide-band-gap materials, showing that supercells with up to 1000 atoms are necessary to obtain converged results. We discuss the validity of the common approximation that solves the BSE with truncated sums over empty and occupied states. We then apply our GW-BSE implementation to a diamond lattice with 1727 atoms to study the symmetry breaking of triplet states caused by the interaction of a point defect with an extended line defect.</description>

      <title>Synatra: Turning Indirect Knowledge into Direct Demonstrations for Digital Agents at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs can now act as autonomous agents that interact with digital environments and complete specific objectives (e.g., arranging an online meeting). However, accuracy is still far from satisfactory, partly due to a lack of large-scale, direct demonstrations for digital tasks. Obtaining supervised data from humans is costly, and automatic data collection through exploration or reinforcement learning relies on complex environmental and content setup, resulting in datasets that lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. On the other hand, there is abundant knowledge that may indirectly assist task completion, such as online tutorials that were created for human consumption. In this work, we present Synatra, an approach that effectively transforms this indirect knowledge into direct supervision at scale. We define different types of indirect knowledge, and carefully study the available sources to obtain it, methods to encode the structure of direct demonstrations, and finally methods to transform indirect knowledge into direct demonstrations. We use 100k such synthetically-created demonstrations to finetune a 7B CodeLlama, and demonstrate that the resulting agent surpasses all comparably sized models on three web-based task benchmarks Mind2Web, MiniWoB++ and WebArena, as well as surpassing GPT-3.5 on WebArena and Mind2Web. In addition, while synthetic demonstrations prove to be only 3% the cost of human demonstrations (at $0.031 each), we show that the synthetic demonstrations can be more effective than an identical number of human demonstrations collected from limited domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of equations has been proposed for a monochromatic weakly nonlinear light wave in a Kerr medium. This system is equivalent up to the third order in electric field to the known equation $\mbox{curl}\,\mbox{curl}\, {\bf E}=k_0^2[{\bf E} +\alpha |{\bf E}|^2{\bf E}+\beta({\bf E}\cdot{\bf E}){\bf E}^*]$, but the new equations are much more convenient for numerical computation. Optical fields with small structures of two or three wavelengths have been simulated using this system. It has been found that a stable self-focused light beam (a 2D vector soliton) in some parametric domain is possible even without modification of nonlinearity. ``Inelastic'' collisions between two such narrow beams with opposite circular polarizations have been computed. Furthermore, examples of interacting optical vortices, spatial separation of the circular polarizations, and the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability have been given for defocusing nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>On the role of Artificial Intelligence methods in modern force-controlled manufacturing robotic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This position paper explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into force-controlled robotic tasks within the scope of advanced manufacturing, a cornerstone of Industry 4.0. AI's role in enhancing robotic manipulators - key drivers in the Fourth Industrial Revolution - is rapidly leading to significant innovations in smart manufacturing. The objective of this article is to frame these innovations in practical force-controlled applications - e.g. deburring, polishing, and assembly tasks like peg-in-hole (PiH) - highlighting their necessity for maintaining high-quality production standards. By reporting on recent AI-based methodologies, this article contrasts them and identifies current challenges to be addressed in future research. The analysis concludes with a perspective on future research directions, emphasizing the need for common performance metrics to validate AI techniques, integration of various enhancements for performance optimization, and the importance of validating them in relevant scenarios. These future directions aim to provide consistency with already adopted approaches, so as to be compatible with manufacturing standards, increasing the relevance of AI-driven methods in both academic and industrial contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a variety of automated collision prevention systems gain presence within personal vehicles, rating and differentiating the automated safety performance of car models has become increasingly important for consumers, manufacturers, and insurers. In 2023, Swiss Re and partners initiated an eight-month long vehicle testing campaign conducted on a recognized UNECE type approval authority and Euro NCAP accredited proving ground in Germany. The campaign exposed twelve mass-produced vehicle models and one prototype vehicle fitted with collision prevention systems to a selection of safety-critical traffic scenarios representative of United States and European Union accident landscape. In this paper, we compare and evaluate the relative safety performance of these thirteen collision prevention systems (hardware and software stack) as demonstrated by this testing campaign. We first introduce a new scoring system which represents a test system's predicted impact on overall real-world collision frequency and reduction of collision impact energy, weighted based on the real-world relevance of the test scenario. Next, we introduce a novel metric that quantifies the realism of the protocol and confirm that our test protocol is a plausible representation of real-world driving. Finally, we find that the prototype system in its pre-release state outperforms the mass-produced (post-consumer-release) vehicles in the majority of the tested scenarios on the test track.</description>

      <title>asQ: parallel-in-time finite element simulations using ParaDiag for geoscientific models and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern high performance computers are massively parallel; for many PDE applications spatial parallelism saturates long before the computer's capability is reached. Parallel-in-time methods enable further speedup beyond spatial saturation by solving multiple timesteps simultaneously to expose additional parallelism. ParaDiag is a particular approach to parallel-in-time based on preconditioning the simultaneous timestep system with a perturbation that allows block diagonalisation via a Fourier transform in time. In this article, we introduce asQ, a new library for implementing ParaDiag parallel-in-time methods, with a focus on applications in the geosciences, especially weather and climate. asQ is built on Firedrake, a library for the automated solution of finite element models, and the PETSc library of scalable linear and nonlinear solvers. This enables asQ to build ParaDiag solvers for general finite element models and provide a range of solution strategies, making testing a wide array of problems straightforward. We use a quasi-Newton formulation that encompasses a range of ParaDiag methods, and expose building blocks for constructing more complex methods. The performance and flexibility of asQ is demonstrated on a hierarchy of linear and nonlinear atmospheric flow models. We show that ParaDiag can offer promising speedups and that asQ is a productive testbed for further developing these methods.</description>

Abstract: Resistive strips Micromegas are employed in the ATLAS New Small Wheel project. They have been already installed and operate in the experimental cavern of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This work attempts to describe the mechanism of the surface electric charge spread on a resistive strip of the Micromegas detector and the created transient electric field. Moreover, an approach utilising the Telegraph partial differential equation, used in transmission lines, is discussed assuming a 2-layer geometry approximation. Finally, the transient electric field formation leading to the strong suppression of the sparks in the amplification region is calculated by using the accurate 3-layer geometry for the particular parameters of the Micromegas configuration. The spatial mapping of this field versus time is presented for the time slice of interest.</description>

      <title>RNG: Relightable Neural Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results for the novel view synthesis task, where lighting is assumed to be fixed. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (fur, fabric, etc.), remains a challenging task. The decomposition between light, geometry, and material is ambiguous, especially if either smooth surface assumptions or surfacebased analytical shading models do not apply. We propose Relightable Neural Gaussians (RNG), a novel 3DGS-based framework that enables the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or soft boundaries, while avoiding assumptions on the shading model. We condition the radiance at each point on both view and light directions. We also introduce a shadow cue, as well as a depth refinement network to improve shadow accuracy. Finally, we propose a hybrid forward-deferred fitting strategy to balance geometry and appearance quality. Our method achieves significantly faster training (1.3 hours) and rendering (60 frames per second) compared to a prior method based on neural radiance fields and produces higher-quality shadows than a concurrent 3DGS-based method.</description>

      <title>SWIM: Short-Window CNN Integrated with Mamba for EEG-Based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result.

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>Completeness and Well-Definability of a Provability Degree Measure in Sufficiently Powerful Formal Systems, and Finite-Time Effective Knowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that including degrees of a particular kind of provability in the search target for any theorem-prover in sufficiently powerful formal systems over finite-sized statements preserves well-definition and a sufficient consistency while establishing completeness. Moreover, the union of such degrees is isomorphic to such a system's {\aleph_0} statements and permits the construction of a best-possible (up to a quadratic term) finite-time theorem knower, {\phi}', while still subject to limitations in these formal systems. These results, owing to the fact that {\phi}' may arise through the behavior of any unbounded inductive computation, establish results on the eventual behavior of a class of computational processes.</description>

      <title>Biases in gendered citation practices: an exploratory study and some reflections on the Matthew and Matilda effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies conducted in different scientific disciplines have concluded that researchers belonging to some socio-cultural groups (e.g., women, racialized people) are usually less cited than other researchers belonging to dominating groups. This is usually due to the presence of citation biases in reference lists. These citation biases towards researchers from some socio-cultural groups may inevitably cause unfairness and inaccuracy in the assessment of articles impact. These citation biases may therefore translate to significant disparities in promotion, retention, grant funding, awards, collaborative opportunities, and publications. In this paper, we conduct the first study aiming at analyzing gendered citation practices in the software engineering (SE) literature. Our study allows reflecting on citations practices adopted in the SE field and serves as a starting point for more robust empirical studies on the analyzed topic. Our results show that some efforts still need to be done to achieve fairness in citation practices in the SE field. Such efforts may notably consist in the inclusion of citation diversity statements in manuscripts submitted for publication in SE journals and conferences.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the combined influence of external driving and dissipation is crucial for studying nonequilibrium quantum phenomena and advancing technological applications. The present study addresses this issue by investigating open-system behavior in driven optical systems coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparisons with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.</description>

      <title>Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</description>

      <title>EndoPerfect: A Hybrid NeRF-Stereo Vision Approach Pioneering Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction in Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) demands exceptional accuracy, with the mean error and standard deviation necessitating within the range of a single CT slice (0.625 mm), as the critical structures in the nasal cavity are situated within submillimeter distances from surgical instruments. This poses a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Depth estimation is crucial for 3D reconstruction, yet existing depth estimation methodologies either suffer from inherent accuracy limitations or, in the case of learning-based approaches, perform poorly when applied to ESS despite succeeding on their original datasets. In this study, we present a novel, highly generalizable method that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and stereo depth estimation for 3D reconstruction that can derive metric monocular depth. Our approach begins with an initial NeRF reconstruction yielding a coarse 3D scene, the subsequent creation of binocular pairs within coarse 3D scene, and generation of depth maps through stereo vision, These depth maps are used to supervise subsequent NeRF iteration, progressively refining NeRF and binocular depth, the refinement process continues until the depth maps converged. This recursive process generates high-accuracy depth maps from monocular endoscopic video. Evaluation in synthetic endoscopy shows a depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm, well within the 0.625 mm threshold. Further clinical experiments with real endoscopic data demonstrate a mean distance to CT mesh of 0.269 mm, representing the highest accuracy among monocular 3D reconstruction methods in ESS.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Quantum Dynamics of Molecules Scattering from Metal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and molecular motion at metal surfaces leads to energy dissipation and dynamical steering effects during chemical surface dynamics. We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by estimating the lead-lag relationships in high-frequency financial data, we propose noisy bivariate Neyman-Scott point processes with gamma kernels (NBNSP-G). NBNSP-G tolerates noises that are not necessarily Poissonian and has an intuitive interpretation. Our experiments suggest that NBNSP-G can explain the correlation of orders of two stocks well. A composite-type quasi-likelihood is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. However, when one tries to prove consistency and asymptotic normality, NBNSP-G breaks the boundedness assumption on the moment density functions commonly assumed in the literature. Therefore, under more relaxed conditions, we show consistency and asymptotic normality for bivariate point process models, which include NBNSP-G. Our numerical simulations also show that the estimator is indeed likely to converge.</description>

Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic, relative deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of empirical covariance and gram matrices in general settings. Unlike typical uniform bounds, which may fail to capture the behavior of smaller eigenvalues, our results provide sharper control across the spectrum. Our analysis is based on a general-purpose theorem that allows one to convert existing uniform bounds into relative ones. The theorems and techniques emphasize simplicity and should be applicable across various settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Here we give it a possible description via probability distributions of energy and/or degrees of freedom. There are parameter spaces that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>On the Achievable Error Rate Performance of Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication and Localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localisation (PASCAL) system. A scenario where multiple drones transmit communication signals to a base station (BS), which needs to simultaneously decode the signals and continuously locate the drones' positions during the communication session, is considered. The BS operates in two stages: first, it estimates the drones' location parameters using pilot signals; second, it performs data detection by reconstructing the channel response based on the estimated location parameters. The theoretical analysis presented demonstrates that the estimated location parameters follow Gaussian distributions with means equal to the actual values and variances determined by the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimator. Using these distributions, the average SER is derived to quantify the impact of localisation errors on decoding performance. This analysis highlights the synergy between communication and localisation, providing valuable insights into the influence of localisation inaccuracies on the performance of location-aware communication systems. Simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical derivations.</description>

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.</description>

      <title>Considerations for Photochemical Modeling of Possible Hycean Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionising the study of temperate sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. The retrieved abundances of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ and non-detection of NH$_3$ and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions of photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However, recent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances may be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore these scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case study. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model assumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar spectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting the resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate scenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18 b. Our analysis shows that the previously favoured mini-Neptune scenario is not compatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios, both inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean scenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH$_4$ which is generally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited Hycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH$_4$ is assumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of systematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical abundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is crucial across various industries and plays a significant role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. We introduce an efficient deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting, capable of predicting rainfall up to 8 hours in advance with greater accuracy than existing operational physics-based and extrapolation-based models. Our model leverages multi-source meteorological data and physics-based forecasts to deliver high-resolution predictions in both time and space. It captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics through temporal attention networks and is optimized using data quality maps and dynamic thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art, and highlight its potential for fast reliable responses to evolving weather conditions.</description>

      <title>MFIT: Multi-Fidelity Thermal Modeling for 2.5D and 3D Multi-Chiplet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly evolving artificial intelligence and machine learning applications require ever-increasing computational capabilities, while monolithic 2D design technologies approach their limits. Heterogeneous integration of smaller chiplets using a 2.5D silicon interposer and 3D packaging has emerged as a promising paradigm to address this limit and meet performance demands. These approaches offer a significant cost reduction and higher manufacturing yield than monolithic 2D integrated circuits. However, the compact arrangement and high compute density exacerbate the thermal management challenges, potentially compromising performance. Addressing these thermal modeling challenges is critical, especially as system sizes grow and different design stages require varying levels of accuracy and speed. Since no single thermal modeling technique meets all these needs, this paper introduces MFIT, a range of multi-fidelity thermal models that effectively balance accuracy and speed. These multi-fidelity models can enable efficient design space exploration and runtime thermal management. Our extensive testing on systems with 16, 36, and 64 2.5D integrated chiplets and 16x3 3D integrated chiplets demonstrates that these models can reduce execution times from days to mere seconds and milliseconds with negligible loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>BlackDAN: A Black-Box Multi-Objective Approach for Effective and Contextual Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.</description>

      <title>ChroKnowledge: Unveiling Chronological Knowledge of Language Models in Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant changes to many aspects of our lives. However, assessing and ensuring their chronological knowledge remains challenging. Existing approaches fall short in addressing the temporal adaptability of knowledge, often relying on a fixed time-point view. To overcome this, we introduce ChroKnowBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate chronologically accumulated knowledge across three key aspects: multiple domains, time dependency, temporal state. Our benchmark distinguishes between knowledge that evolves (e.g., personal history, scientific discoveries, amended laws) and knowledge that remain constant (e.g., mathematical truths, commonsense facts). Building on this benchmark, we present ChroKnowledge (Chronological Categorization of Knowledge), a novel sampling-based framework for evaluating LLMs' non-parametric chronological knowledge. Our evaluation led to the following observations: (1) The ability of eliciting temporal knowledge varies depending on the data format that model was trained on. (2) LLMs partially recall knowledge or show a cut-off at temporal boundaries rather than recalling all aspects of knowledge correctly. Thus, we apply ourChroKnowPrompt, an in-depth prompting to elicit chronological knowledge by traversing step-by-step through the surrounding time spans. We observe that it successfully recalls objects across both open-source and proprietary LLMs, demonstrating versatility, though it faces challenges with dynamic datasets and unstructured formats.</description>

      <title>Random vectors in the presence of a single big jump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multidimensional distributions with heavy tails attracted recently the attention of several papers on Applied Probability. However, the most of the works of the last decades are focused on multivariate regular variation, while the rest of the heavy-tailed distribution classes were not studied extensively. About the multivariate subexponentiality we can find several approximations, but none of them get established widely. Having in mind the single big jump and further the multivariate subexponentiality suggested by Samorodnitsky and Sun (2016), we introduce the multivariate long, dominatedly and constistently varying distribution classes. We examine the closure properties of these classes with respect to product convolution, to scale mixture and convolution of random vectors. Especially in the class of multivariate subexponential and dominatedly varying distributions we provide the asymptotic behavior of the random vector and its normalized Levy measure, through their linear combination, that leads to their characterization. Furthermore, we study the single big jump in finite and in random sums of random vectors, permitting some dependence structures, which contain the independence as special case. Finally, we present an application on the asymptotic evaluation of the present value of the total claims in a risk model, with common Poisson counting process, general financial factors and independent, identically distributed claims, with common multivariate subexponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Individual solid-state nuclear spin qubits with coherence exceeding seconds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to coherently control and read out qubits with long coherence times in a scalable system is a crucial requirement for any quantum processor. Nuclear spins in the solid state have shown great promise as long-lived qubits. Control and readout of individual nuclear spin qubit registers has made major progress in the recent years using individual electron spin ancilla addressed either electrically or optically. Here, we present a new platform for quantum information processing, consisting of $^{183}$W nuclear spin qubits adjacent to an Er$^{3+}$ impurity in a CaWO$_4$ crystal, interfaced via a superconducting resonator and detected using a microwave photon counter at 10mK. We study two nuclear spin qubits with $T_2^*$ of $0.8(2)~$s and $1.2(3)~$s, $T_2$ of $3.4(4)~$s and $4.4(6)~$ s, respectively. We demonstrate single-shot quantum non-demolition readout of each nuclear spin qubit using the Er$^{3+}$ spin as an ancilla. We introduce a new scheme for all-microwave single- and two-qubit gates, based on stimulated Raman driving of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. We realize single- and two-qubit gates on a timescale of a few milliseconds, and prepare a decoherence-protected Bell state with 88% fidelity and $T_2^*$ of $1.7(2)~$s. Our results are a proof-of-principle demonstrating the potential of solid-state nuclear spin qubits as a promising platform for quantum information processing. With the potential to scale to tens or hundreds of qubits, this platform has prospects for the development of scalable quantum processors with long-lived qubits.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimize for Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11061v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-integer non-linear programs (MINLPs) arise in various domains, such as energy systems and transportation, but are notoriously difficult to solve. Recent advances in machine learning have led to remarkable successes in optimization tasks, an area broadly known as learning to optimize. This approach includes using predictive models to generate solutions for optimization problems with continuous decision variables, thereby avoiding the need for computationally expensive optimization algorithms. However, applying learning to MINLPs remains challenging primarily due to the presence of integer decision variables, which complicate gradient-based learning. To address this limitation, we propose two differentiable correction layers that generate integer outputs while preserving gradient information. Combined with a soft penalty for constraint violation, our framework can tackle both the integrality and non-linear constraints in a MINLP. Experiments on three problem classes with convex/non-convex objective/constraints and integer/mixed-integer variables show that the proposed learning-based approach consistently produces high-quality solutions for parametric MINLPs extremely quickly. As problem size increases, traditional exact solvers and heuristic methods struggle to find feasible solutions, whereas our approach continues to deliver reliable results. Our work extends the scope of learning-to-optimize to MINLP, paving the way for integrating integer constraints into deep learning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/pnnl/L2O-pMINLP.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated that collective intelligence can significantly surpass the capabilities of individual agents, primarily due to well-crafted inter-agent communication topologies. Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.</description>

      <title>FoundTS: Comprehensive and Unified Benchmarking of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, including in finance, weather services, and energy management. While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Proactive Agent: Shifting LLM Agents from Reactive Responses to Active Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.</description>

      <title>How Does Variance Shape the Regret in Contextual Bandits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider realizable contextual bandits with general function approximation, investigating how small reward variance can lead to better-than-minimax regret bounds. Unlike in minimax bounds, we show that the eluder dimension $d_\text{elu}$$-$a complexity measure of the function class$-$plays a crucial role in variance-dependent bounds. We consider two types of adversary:
  (1) Weak adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance before observing the learner's action. In this setting, we prove that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{A,d_\text{elu}\}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $d_{\text{elu}}\leq\sqrt{AT}$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\Lambda$ is the total variance over $T$ rounds. For the $A\leq d_\text{elu}$ regime, we derive a nearly matching upper bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ for the special case where the variance is revealed at the beginning of each round.
  (2) Strong adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance after observing the learner's action. We show that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. In this setting, we provide an upper bound of order $\tilde{O}(d_\text{elu}\sqrt{\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.
  Furthermore, we examine the setting where the function class additionally provides distributional information of the reward, as studied by Wang et al. (2024). We demonstrate that the regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ established in their work is unimprovable when $\sqrt{d_{\text{elu}}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. However, with a slightly different definition of the total variance and with the assumption that the reward follows a Gaussian distribution, one can achieve a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and demonstrate that an analogue gravity model going beyond the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This requires that one expands to second order in perturbation amplitude and thus takes the intrinsic nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that, as a result, significant modifications of the standard paradigm occur. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal mean-field expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh acoustic spacetime metric and, to subleading order $1/N$, two emergent vector fields and a mass term. Both the renormalized metric as well as the vector fields and the mass then keep track of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to the quantum many-body backreaction exerted by the excitation cloud.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of densely confined active polar disks with self- and mutual alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emerging collective states in a simple mechanical model of a dense group of self-propelled polar disks with off-centered rotation, confined within a circular arena. Each disk presents self-alignment towards the sum of contact forces acting on it, resulting from disk-substrate interactions, while also displaying mutual alignment with neighbors due to having its center of rotation located a distance R behind its centroid so that central contact forces can also introduce torques. The effect of both alignment mechanisms produces a variety of collective states that combine high-frequency localized circular oscillations with low-frequency milling around the center of the arena, in fluid or solid regimes. We consider cases with small/large R values, isotropic/anisotropic disk-substrate damping, smooth/rough arena boundaries, different densities, and multiple systems sizes, showing that the emergent collective states that we identify are robust, generic, and potentially observable in real-world natural or artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Sim2real Cattle Joint Estimation in 3D point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the well-being of cattle is crucial in various agricultural contexts. Cattle's body shape and joint articulation carry significant information about their welfare, yet acquiring comprehensive datasets for 3D body pose estimation presents a formidable challenge. This study delves into the construction of such a dataset specifically tailored for cattle. Leveraging the expertise of digital artists, we use a single animated 3D model to represent diverse cattle postures. To address the disparity between virtual and real-world data, we augment the 3D model's shape to encompass a range of potential body appearances, thereby narrowing the "sim2real" gap. We use these annotated models to train a deep-learning framework capable of estimating internal joints solely based on external surface curvature. Our contribution is specifically the use of geodesic distance over the surface manifold, coupled with multilateration to extract joints in a semantic keypoint detection encoder-decoder architecture. We demonstrate the robustness of joint extraction by comparing the link lengths extracted on real cattle mobbing and walking within a race. Furthermore, inspired by the established allometric relationship between bone length and the overall height of mammals, we utilise the estimated joints to predict hip height within a real cattle dataset, extending the utility of our approach to offer insights into improving cattle monitoring practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The D0-brane/Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix theory is a strongly coupled quantum system with an interesting gravity dual. We develop a scheme to derive bootstrap bounds on simple correlators in the matrix theory at infinite $N$ at zero energy by imposing the supercharge equations of motion. By exploiting SO(9) symmetry, we are able to consider single-trace operators involving words of length up to 9 using very modest computational resources. We interpret our initial results as strong evidence that the bootstrap method can efficiently access physics in the strongly coupled, infinite $N$ regime.</description>

      <title>Agent Skill Acquisition for Large Language Models via CycleQD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.</description>

      <title>On Designing Effective RL Reward at Training Time for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: We present OpenMU-Bench, a large-scale benchmark suite for addressing the data scarcity issue in training multimodal language models to understand music. To construct OpenMU-Bench, we leveraged existing datasets and bootstrapped new annotations. OpenMU-Bench also broadens the scope of music understanding by including lyrics understanding and music tool usage. Using OpenMU-Bench, we trained our music understanding model, OpenMU, with extensive ablations, demonstrating that OpenMU outperforms baseline models such as MU-Llama. Both OpenMU and OpenMU-Bench are open-sourced to facilitate future research in music understanding and to enhance creative music production efficiency.</description>

Abstract: A few years ago Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko introduced an interesting quantization of the real numbers as certain power series in a quantization parameter $q.$ It is known now that the golden ratio has minimal radius among all these series. We study the rational numbers having maximal radius of convergence equal to 1, which we call Kronecker fractions. We prove that the corresponding continued fraction expansions must be palindromic and describe all Kronecker fractions with prime denominators. We found several infinite families of Kronecker fractions and all Kronecker fractions with denominator less than 5000. We also comment on the irrational case and on the relation with braids, rational knots and links.</description>

      <title>S-CFE: Simple Counterfactual Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding optimal sparse, manifold-aligned counterfactual explanations for classifiers. Canonically, this can be formulated as an optimization problem with multiple non-convex components, including classifier loss functions and manifold alignment (or \emph{plausibility}) metrics. The added complexity of enforcing \emph{sparsity}, or shorter explanations, complicates the problem further. Existing methods often focus on specific models and plausibility measures, relying on convex $\ell_1$ regularizers to enforce sparsity. In this paper, we tackle the canonical formulation using the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method, a simple yet efficient first-order procedure capable of handling smooth non-convex objectives and non-smooth $\ell_p$ (where $0 \leq p &lt; 1$) regularizers. This enables our approach to seamlessly incorporate various classifiers and plausibility measures while producing sparser solutions. Our algorithm only requires differentiable data-manifold regularizers and supports box constraints for bounded feature ranges, ensuring the generated counterfactuals remain \emph{actionable}. Finally, experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively produces sparse, manifold-aligned counterfactual explanations while maintaining proximity to the factual data and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and location of ongoing extreme particle acceleration in Cassiopeia A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the origin of energetic cosmic rays (CRs) below the "knee" of their spectrum at $\sim3$ petaelectronvolt (PeV, $10^{15}$ eV). Nevertheless, the precise location, duration, and operation of CR acceleration in young SNRs are open questions. Here, we report on multi-epoch X-ray observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a 350-year-old SNR, in the 15-50 keV band that probes the most energetic CR electrons. The observed X-ray flux decrease $(15\pm1\%)$, contrary to the expected $&gt;$90\% decrease based on previous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations, provides unambiguous evidence for CR electron acceleration operating in Cas A. A temporal model for the radio and X-ray data accounting for electron cooling and continuous injection finds that the freshly injected electron spectrum is significantly harder (exponential cutoff power law index $q=2.15$), and its cutoff energy is much higher ($E_{cut}=36$ TeV) than the relic electron spectrum ($q=2.44\pm0.03$, $E_{cut}=4\pm1$ TeV). Both electron spectra are naturally explained by the recently developed modified nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (mNLDSA) mechanism. The CR protons producing the observed gamma rays are likely accelerated at the same location by the same mechanism as those for the injected electron. The Cas A observations and spectral modeling represent the first time radio, X-ray, gamma ray and CR spectra have been self-consistently tied to a specific acceleration mechanism -- mNLDSA -- in a young SNR.</description>

Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-beam microscopy and spectroscopy featuring atomic-scale spatial resolution have become essential tools used daily in almost all branches of nanoscale science and technology. As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron--light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multi-layer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completely buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon-electron events in their quantum interaction. Our findings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various electron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in free-electron quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Creativity in AI: Progresses and Challenges</title>

Abstract: Creativity is the ability to produce novel, useful, and surprising ideas, and has been widely studied as a crucial aspect of human cognition. Machine creativity on the other hand has been a long-standing challenge. With the rise of advanced generative AI, there has been renewed interest and debate regarding AI's creative capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the state of creativity in AI and identify key progresses and remaining challenges. In this work, we survey leading works studying the creative capabilities of AI systems, focusing on creative problem-solving, linguistic, artistic, and scientific creativity. Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely capable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as poems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require creative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their generations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range incoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning copyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is process-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we propose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boosted dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total dark matter in the universe, with mass ranging from eV to MeV and often exhibiting (semi)relativistic velocity. Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark matter in earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is more than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter(subdominant) including the two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter species(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter particles in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter species is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves very high velocity. These boosted dark matter particles suffer from elastic scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere and the earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the kinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two component dark matter scenario, we show that the boost of the dark matter, kinetic energy and its attenuation highly depend on the dark matter masses. We perform a detailed study of the attenuation of boosted dark matter as a function of the DM-nucleus (without/with form factor) and DM-electron cross sections. For a 10 MeV dark matter with boost $\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe than the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) for scattering cross sections $\sim 10^{-29}$cm$^2$. We also found that the attenuation of the kinetic energy results in a shift in the peak position of the boosted dark matter flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript summarizes work on the Capsule Vision Challenge 2024 by MISAHUB. To address the multi-class disease classification task, which is challenging due to the complexity and imbalance in the Capsule Vision challenge dataset, this paper proposes CASCRNet (Capsule endoscopy-Aspp-SCR-Network), a parameter-efficient and novel model that uses Shared Channel Residual (SCR) blocks and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) blocks. Further, the performance of the proposed model is compared with other well-known approaches. The experimental results yield that proposed model provides better disease classification results. The proposed model was successful in classifying diseases with an F1 Score of 78.5% and a Mean AUC of 98.3%, which is promising given its compact architecture.</description>

      <title>The diameter of random spanning trees interpolating between the UST and the MST of the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ as the weighted spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ w.r.t. the random electric network of conductances $\{\exp(-\beta_nU_{e})\}_{e\in E(K_n)}$ with $\mathrm{Unif}[0,1]$ i.i.d. $U_e$'s.
  Moving from $\beta_n\equiv 0$ to faster and faster growing $\beta_n$'s, the model interpolates between the \emph{uniform} and the \emph{minimum} spanning trees: $\mathsf{WST}^0(K_n)=\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$, and there are phase transitions for $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ behaving more and more like $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$:
  - around $\beta_n=n^{3+o(1)}$ regarding the agreement of the two standard algorithms generating these models : Aldous-Broder and Prim's invasion algorithms,
  - around $\beta_n=n^{2+o(1)}$ regarding the models consisting of exactly the same edges, and
  - around $\beta_n=n^{1+o(1)}$ regarding the expected total length $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{e\in \mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)}U_e\right]$.
  But most importantly, we study the global geometry of the model: we prove that the typical diameter of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ grows like $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for $\beta_n\ge n^{4/3+o(1)}$ likewise the $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$ case, and it grows like $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ for $\beta_n\le n^{1+o(1)}$ similarly to the $\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$ case. For $\beta_n=n^{\alpha}$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;4/3$, the behavior of the typical diameter is a more delicate open question, but we conjecture that its exponent strictly between 1/2 and 1/3.</description>

      <title>Citywide Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction Approach Considering Urban Region and Dynamic Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging demand prediction is important for vacant charging pile recommendation and charging infrastructure planning, thus facilitating vehicle electrification and green energy development. The performance of previous spatio-temporal studies is still far from satisfactory nowadays because urban region attributes and multivariate temporal influences are not adequately taken into account. To tackle these issues, we propose a learning approach for citywide electric vehicle charging demand prediction, named CityEVCP. To learn non-pairwise relationships in urban areas, we cluster service areas by the types and numbers of points of interest in the areas and develop attentive hypergraph networks accordingly. Graph attention mechanisms are employed for information propagation between neighboring areas. Additionally, we propose a variable selection network to adaptively learn dynamic auxiliary information and improve the Transformer encoder utilizing gated mechanisms for fluctuating charging time-series data. Experiments on a citywide electric vehicle charging dataset demonstrate the performances of our proposed approach compared with a broad range of competing baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of dynamic influences on prediction results in different areas of the city and the effectiveness of our area clustering method.</description>

      <title>MoGe: Unlocking Accurate Monocular Geometry Estimation for Open-Domain Images with Optimal Training Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MoGe, a powerful model for recovering 3D geometry from monocular open-domain images. Given a single image, our model directly predicts a 3D point map of the captured scene with an affine-invariant representation, which is agnostic to true global scale and shift. This new representation precludes ambiguous supervision in training and facilitate effective geometry learning. Furthermore, we propose a set of novel global and local geometry supervisions that empower the model to learn high-quality geometry. These include a robust, optimal, and efficient point cloud alignment solver for accurate global shape learning, and a multi-scale local geometry loss promoting precise local geometry supervision. We train our model on a large, mixed dataset and demonstrate its strong generalizability and high accuracy. In our comprehensive evaluation on diverse unseen datasets, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all tasks, including monocular estimation of 3D point map, depth map, and camera field of view. Code and models can be found on our project page.</description>

      <title>Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.</description>

      <title>ShifCon: Enhancing Non-Dominant Language Capabilities with a Shift-based Contrastive Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multilingual data can rapidly enhance the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit a performance gap between the dominant language (e.g., English) and non-dominant ones due to the imbalance of training data across languages. To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment of representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon framework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages, particularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to verify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research</description>

Abstract: A recent phenomenological study of radio emission from normal and millisecond pulsars by Karastergiou et al has lead these authors to state that they are unable to exclude a common physics process as the source although the rotation periods and magnetic fields of these two classes are very different. This has bearing on the nature of that source and it is the purpose the present Letter to explore this problem further, specifically for the ion-proton model and for all those models that assume electron-positron pair creation above the polar cap. The ion-proton model satisfies this commonality whereas pair creation does not. We mention briefly some consequences of these findings.</description>

Abstract: The {\it finiteness} of the mixed state entanglement entropy $S_{\text{vN}}$ in CFT$_2$ enables us to show that, the dynamical equation of the coincidence limit of $(\frac{1}{2} S_{vN}^2);_{ij}$ is precisely three dimensional Einstein equation. A profound relation between the cosmological constant and CFT$_2$ entanglement entropy is given. Thus entanglement entropies induce internal gravitational geometries in CFT$_2$. Deriving the dual metric from an entanglement entropy becomes a trivial procedure. Remarkably, we show that the renormalization group equation is a geometric identity.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator Pretraining for Solving Time-Dependent PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretraining methods gain increasing attraction recently for solving PDEs with neural operators. It alleviates the data scarcity problem encountered by neural operator learning when solving single PDE via training on large-scale datasets consisting of various PDEs and utilizing shared patterns among different PDEs to improve the solution precision. In this work, we propose the Latent Neural Operator Pretraining (LNOP) framework based on the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) backbone. We achieve universal transformation through pretraining on hybrid time-dependent PDE dataset to extract representations of different physical systems and solve various time-dependent PDEs in the latent space through finetuning on single PDE dataset. Our proposed LNOP framework reduces the solution error by 31.7% on four problems and can be further improved to 57.1% after finetuning. On out-of-distribution dataset, our LNOP model achieves roughly 50% lower error and 3$\times$ data efficiency on average across different dataset sizes. These results show that our method is more competitive in terms of solution precision, transfer capability and data efficiency compared to non-pretrained neural operators.</description>

      <title>Improved Spectral Density Estimation via Explicit and Implicit Deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algorithms for approximating the spectral density of a symmetric matrix $A$ that is accessed through matrix-vector product queries. By combining a previously studied Chebyshev polynomial moment matching method with a deflation step that approximately projects off the largest magnitude eigendirections of $A$ before estimating the spectral density, we give an $\epsilon\cdot\sigma_\ell(A)$ error approximation to the spectral density in the Wasserstein-$1$ metric using $O(\ell\log n+ 1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products, where $\sigma_\ell(A)$ is the $\ell^{th}$ largest singular value of $A$. In the common case when $A$ exhibits fast singular value decay, our bound can be much stronger than prior work, which gives an error bound of $\epsilon \cdot ||A||_2$ using $O(1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products. We also show that it is nearly tight: any algorithm giving error $\epsilon \cdot \sigma_\ell(A)$ must use $\Omega(\ell+1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products.
  We further show that the popular Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) method matches the above bound, even though SLQ itself is parameter-free and performs no explicit deflation. This bound explains the strong practical performance of SLQ, and motivates a simple variant of SLQ that achieves an even tighter error bound. Our error bound for SLQ leverages an analysis that views it as an implicit polynomial moment matching method, along with recent results on low-rank approximation with single-vector Krylov methods. We use these results to show that the method can perform implicit deflation as part of moment matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $(\mathcal{M},d)$ is an $n$-point metric space that embeds quasisymmetrically into a Hilbert space, then for every $\tau&gt;0$ there is a random subset $\mathcal{Z}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ such that for any pair of points $x,y\in \mathcal{M}$ with $d(x,y)\ge \tau$, the probability that both $x\in \mathcal{Z}$ and $d(y,\mathcal{Z})\ge \beta\tau/\sqrt{1+\log (|B(y,\kappa \beta \tau)|/|B(y,\beta \tau)|)}$ is $\Omega(1)$, where $\kappa&gt;1$ is a universal constant and $\beta&gt;0$ depends only on the modulus of the quasisymmetric embedding. The proof relies on a refinement of the Arora--Rao--Vazirani rounding technique. Among the applications of this result is that the largest possible Euclidean distortion of an $n$-point subset of $\ell_1$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$, and the integrality gap of the Goemans--Linial semidefinite program for the Sparsest Cut problem on inputs of size $n$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$. Multiple further applications are given.</description>

      <title>CHORDONOMICON: A Dataset of 666,000 Songs and their Chord Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22046</link>

Abstract: Chord progressions encapsulate important information about music, pertaining to its structure and conveyed emotions. They serve as the backbone of musical composition, and in many cases, they are the sole information required for a musician to play along and follow the music. Despite their importance, chord progressions as a data domain remain underexplored. There is a lack of large-scale datasets suitable for deep learning applications, and limited research exploring chord progressions as an input modality. In this work, we present Chordonomicon, a dataset of over 666,000 songs and their chord progressions, annotated with structural parts, genre, and release date - created by scraping various sources of user-generated progressions and associated metadata. We demonstrate the practical utility of the Chordonomicon dataset for classification and generation tasks, and discuss its potential to provide valuable insights to the research community. Chord progressions are unique in their ability to be represented in multiple formats (e.g. text, graph) and the wealth of information chords convey in given contexts, such as their harmonic function . These characteristics make the Chordonomicon an ideal testbed for exploring advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers, graph machine learning, and hybrid systems that combine knowledge representation and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Competition between simple and complex contagion on temporal networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral adoptions are influenced by peers in different ways. While some individuals may change after a single incoming influence, others need multiple cumulated attempts. These two mechanism, known as the simple and the complex contagions, often occur together in social phenomena alongside personal factors determining individual adoptions. Here we aim to identify, which of these contagion mechanism dominate a spreading process propagated by time-varying interactions. We consider three types of spreading scenarios: ones pre-dominated by simple or complex contagion, and mixed dynamics where the dominant mechanism changes during the unfolding of the spreading process. We propose different methods to analytically identify the transitions between these three scenarios and compare them with numerical simulations. This work offers new insights into social contagion dynamics on temporal networks, without assuming prior knowledge about individual's contagion mechanism driving their adoption decisions.</description>

      <title>On $\mathrm{F}$-spaces of almost-Lebesgue functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the space of functions almost in $L_p$ equipped with the topology of asymptotic $L_p$-convergence. This space is shown to form a completely metrizable topological vector space, extending the space of measurable functions with the topology of convergence in measure to infinite measure spaces. Classical properties, including dominated convergence, Vitali convergence theorems, and Marcinkiewicz interpolation, are investigated. For $ \mathbb{R}^d $ as the underlying measure space, results on approximation by smooth functions, separability, and the boundedness of maximal functions are established. Key topological features, such as local boundedness, local convexity, and duality, are explored, revealing fundamental differences from standard $L_p$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Transferable Ensemble Black-box Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak attacking framework that incorporates various LLM-as-Attacker methods to deliver transferable and powerful jailbreak attacks. Our method is designed based on three key observations from existing jailbreaking studies and practices. First, we consider an ensemble approach should be more effective in exposing the vulnerabilities of an aligned LLM compared to individual attacks. Second, different malicious instructions inherently vary in their jailbreaking difficulty, necessitating differentiated treatment to ensure more efficient attacks. Finally, the semantic coherence of a malicious instruction is crucial for triggering the defenses of an aligned LLM; therefore, it must be carefully disrupted to manipulate its embedding representation, thereby increasing the jailbreak success rate. We validated our approach by participating in the Competition for LLM and Agent Safety 2024, where our team achieved top performance in the Jailbreaking Attack Track.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but raise ethical concerns due to embedded social biases. This study examines LLM biases against Arabs versus Westerners across eight domains, including women's rights, terrorism, and anti-Semitism and assesses model resistance to perpetuating these biases. To this end, we create two datasets: one to evaluate LLM bias toward Arabs versus Westerners and another to test model safety against prompts that exaggerate negative traits ("jailbreaks"). We evaluate six LLMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, LlaMA 3.1 (8B &amp; 405B), Mistral 7B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find 79% of cases displaying negative biases toward Arabs, with LlaMA 3.1-405B being the most biased. Our jailbreak tests reveal GPT-4o as the most vulnerable, despite being an optimized version, followed by LlaMA 3.1-8B and Mistral 7B. All LLMs except Claude exhibit attack success rates above 87% in three categories. We also find Claude 3.5 Sonnet the safest, but it still displays biases in seven of eight categories. Despite being an optimized version of GPT4, We find GPT-4o to be more prone to biases and jailbreaks, suggesting optimization flaws. Our findings underscore the pressing need for more robust bias mitigation strategies and strengthened security measures in LLMs.</description>

      <title>What the %PCSA? Addressing Diversity in Lower-Limb Musculoskeletal Models: Age- and Sex-related Differences in PCSA and Muscle Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) models offer a non-invasive way to understand biomechanical loads on joints and tendons, which are difficult to measure directly. Variations in muscle strength, especially relative differences between muscles, significantly impact model outcomes. Typically, scaled generic MSK models use maximum isometric forces that are not adjusted for different demographics, raising concerns about their accuracy. This review provides an overview on experimentally derived strength parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), muscle mass (Mm), and relative muscle mass (%Mm), which is the relative distribution of muscle mass across the leg. We analysed differences by age and sex, and compared open-source lower limb MSK model parameters with experimental data from 57 studies. Our dataset, with records dating back to 1884, shows that uniformly increasing all maximum isometric forces in MSK models does not capture key muscle ratio differences due to age and sex. Males have a higher proportion of muscle mass in the rectus femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while females have a greater relative muscle mass in the pelvic (gluteus maximus and medius) and ankle muscles (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and extensor digitorum longus). Older adults have a higher relative muscle mass in the gluteus medius, while younger individuals show more in the gastrocnemius. Current MSK models do not accurately represent muscle mass distribution for specific age or sex groups, and none of them accurately reflect female muscle mass distribution. Further research is needed to explore musculotendon age- and sex differences.</description>

      <title>Exploring New Physics in transition $b\to s\,\ell^+\ell^-$ through different $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the discrepancies observed in the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ neutral current decays, we study the decay channel $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=\mu,\tau$), which is based on the same flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) transition at the quark level. The current study shows that this decay channel can provide a useful probe for physics beyond the standard model. We use the helicity formalism while employing the effective theory approach where we include the effects of vector and axial vector `new' physics (NP) operators. In this study, we have computed the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}_r$, the $D^\ast$ helicity fraction $f_L$, the lepton forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$, and the lepton flavor universality ratio (LFU) $R^{\tau\mu}_{D_s^*}$. In addition, as a complementary check on the LFU, we also calculate the various other LFU observables, $R_{i}^{\tau\mu}$ where $i=A_{FB}$, $f_L$. We assume that the NP universal coupling is present for both muons and tauons, while the non-universal coupling is only present for muons. Regarding these couplings, we employ the latest global fit to the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data, which is recently computed in arXiv:2304.07330. We give predictions of some of the mentioned observables within the SM and the various NP scenarios. We have found that not only are the considered observables sensitive to NP but are also helpful in distinguishing among the different NP scenarios. These results can be tested at the LHCb, HL-LHC, and FCC-ee, and therefore, a precise measurements of these observables not only deepens our understanding of the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ process but also provides a window of opportunity to possibly study various NP scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use large-$N$ diagrammatic techniques to calculate the relative entropy of symmetric random states drawn from the Wishart ensemble. These methods are specifically designed for symmetric sectors, allowing us to determine the relative entropy for random states exhibiting $U(1)$ symmetry. This calculation serves as a measure of distinguishability within the symmetry sectors of random states. Our findings reveal that the symmetry-resolved relative entropy of random pure states displays universal statistical behavior. Furthermore, we derive the symmetry-resolved Page curve. These results deepen our understanding of the properties of these random states.</description>

      <title>Periodic colorings and orientations in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>Cross-D Conv: Cross-Dimensional Transferable Knowledge Base via Fourier Shifting Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biomedical imaging analysis, the dichotomy between 2D and 3D data presents a significant challenge. While 3D volumes offer superior real-world applicability, they are less available for each modality and not easy to train in large scale, whereas 2D samples are abundant but less comprehensive. This paper introduces the Cross-D Conv operation, a novel approach that bridges the dimensional gap by learning the phase shifting in the Fourier domain. Our method enables seamless weight transfer between 2D and 3D convolution operations, effectively facilitating cross-dimensional learning. The proposed architecture leverages the abundance of 2D training data to enhance 3D model performance, offering a practical solution to the multimodal data scarcity challenge in 3D medical model pretraining. Experimental validation on the RadImagenet (2D) and multimodal (3D) sets demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance in feature quality assessment comparable to conventional methods. The enhanced convolution operation presents new opportunities for developing efficient classification and segmentation models in medical imaging. This work represents an advancement in cross-dimensional and multi-modal medical image analysis, offering a robust framework for utilizing 2D priors in 3D model pretraining or vice versa while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication for Wireless Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) has facilitated the development of computation-intensive applications like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which integrates visual perception and natural language processing to generate answers. To overcome the limitations of traditional VQA constrained by local computation resources, edge computing has been incorporated to provide extra computation capability at the edge side. Meanwhile, this brings new communication challenges between the local and edge, including limited bandwidth, channel noise, and multipath effects, which degrade VQA performance and user quality of experience (QoE), particularly during the transmission of large high-resolution images. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework that focuses on effectively extracting and transmitting semantic information most relevant to the VQA goals, improving the answering accuracy and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency. The objective is to maximize the answering accuracy, and we propose a bounding box (BBox)-based image semantic extraction and ranking approach to prioritize the semantic information based on the goal of questions. We then extend it by incorporating a scene graphs (SG)-based approach to handle questions with complex relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our GSC framework improves answering accuracy by up to 49% under AWGN channels and 59% under Rayleigh channels while reducing total latency by up to 65% compared to traditional bit-oriented transmission.</description>

Abstract: On a Riemann surface of genus $&gt; 1$, we discuss how to construct opers with apparent singularities from $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ $\lambda$-connections $(E, \nabla_\lambda)$ and sub-line bundles $L$ of $E$. This construction defines a rational map from a space which captures important data of triples $(E, L, \nabla_\lambda)$ to a space which parametrises the positions and residue parameters of the induced apparent singularities. We show that this is a Poisson map with respect to natural Poisson structures. The relations to wobbly bundles and Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and $\lambda$-connections are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. In geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V.~Arnold in the 1960s, one considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain with respect to the metric defined by the kinetic energy. Similar considerations on the space of densities lead to a geometric description of optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and the Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometric description and can be regarded as a higher-order Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this work we review various metrics on diffeomorphism groups relevant to this approach and introduce appropriate topology, smooth structures and dynamics on the corresponding infinite-dimensional manifolds. Our main goal is to demonstrate how, alongside topological hydrodynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics and optimal mass transport, information geometry with its elaborate toolbox has become yet another exciting field for applications of geometric analysis on diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Towards More Accurate US Presidential Election via Multi-step Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) accurately predict election outcomes? While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains, including healthcare, legal analysis, and creative tasks, their ability to forecast elections remains unknown. Election prediction poses unique challenges, such as limited voter-level data, rapidly changing political landscapes, and the need to model complex human behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-step reasoning framework designed for political analysis. Our approach is validated on real-world data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 and 2020, as well as synthetic personas generated by the leading machine learning framework, offering scalable datasets for voter behavior modeling. To capture temporal dynamics, we incorporate candidates' policy positions and biographical details, ensuring that the model adapts to evolving political contexts. Drawing on Chain of Thought prompting, our multi-step reasoning pipeline systematically integrates demographic, ideological, and time-dependent factors, enhancing the model's predictive power.</description>

      <title>A family of Fourier transform's eigenfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a family of Fourier eigenfunctions indexed by the space dimension d. These eigenfunctions are radial and built upon some generalized exponential integral function. For d=1,2,3, they are integrable or square integrable and give new explicit examples of Fourier eigenfunctions in the usual or Fourier-Plancherel sense. For d&gt;3, the functions are examples of non standard eigenfunctions, i.e. eigenfunctions in the sense of distribution. The discovery of these eigenfunctions stems from research in thermal lens spectroscopy, at the intersection of thermodynamics and optics. Their use could simplify the analysis of thermo-optical systems, paving the way for applications in optical computing, material studies and thermodynamic.</description>

      <title>Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal geographic placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in drinking water distribution networks (WDNs), with a specific focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is indeed inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, and as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a simple algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The presented algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic system sciences and observability theory, and yields sensor placements that are robust to hydraulic changes. Thorough case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Number Counterexample Checking and One Vertex Extension Linearly Bound by $s$ and $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that all graphs of size $n$ contain a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$ is the set of all counterexample graphs without this property for a given $n$. We prove that if a graph $G_{n+1}$ of size $n+1$ has $\max\{s,t\}+1$ subgraphs in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$, then $G_{n+1}$ is in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n+1)$. Based on this, we introduce algorithms for one-vertex extension and counterexample checking with runtime linearly bound by $s$ and $t$. We prove the utility of these algorithms by verifying $\mathcal{R}(4,6,36)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,43)$ are empty given current sets $\mathcal{R}(4,6,35)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,42)$.</description>

      <title>Medial quandles's capability of detecting causality and properties of their coloring on certain links and knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04477v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigated the capability of medial quandle, quandle whose operation satisfying that $(a_1*b_1)*(a_2*b_2)=(a_1*a_2)*(b_1*b_2)$, to detect causality in (2+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime by determining if they can distinguished the connected sum of two Hopf links from an infinite series of relevant three-component links constructed by Allen and Swenberg in 2020, who suggested that any link invariant must be able to distinguish those links for them to detect causality in the given setting. I show that these quandles fail to do so as long as $a\sim b\Leftrightarrow a*b=a$ defines an equivalence relation. The Alexander quandles is an example that this result can apply to. Inspired by this result, I also derived a generalized theorem about the coloring of medial quandles on a specific type of tangles, which help to determine whether this quandles can distinguish between a wider range of knots and links or not.</description>

      <title>An exploration of connections and curvature in the presence of singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the notions of connections and curvature for general Lie-Rinehart algebras without using smoothness assumptions on the base space. We present situations when a connection exists. E.g., this is the case when the underlying module is finitely generated. We show how the group of module automorphism acts as gauge transformations on the space of connections. When the underlying module is projective we define a version of the Chern character reproducing results of Hideki Ozeki. We discuss various examples of flat connections and the associated Maurer-Cartan equations. We provide examples of Levi-Civita connections on singular varieties and singular differential spaces with non-zero Riemannian curvature. The main observation is that for quotient singularities, even though the metric degenerates along strata, the poles of the Christoffel symbols are removable.</description>

      <title>ImpScore: A Learnable Metric For Quantifying The Implicitness Level of Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handling implicit language is essential for natural language processing systems to achieve precise text understanding and facilitate natural interactions with users. Despite its importance, the absence of a metric for accurately measuring the implicitness of language significantly constrains the depth of analysis possible in evaluating models' comprehension capabilities. This paper addresses this gap by developing a scalar metric that quantifies the implicitness level of language without relying on external references. Drawing on principles from traditional linguistics, we define ''implicitness'' as the divergence between semantic meaning and pragmatic interpretation. To operationalize this definition, we introduce ImpScore, a novel, reference-free metric formulated through an interpretable regression model. This model is trained using pairwise contrastive learning on a specially curated dataset comprising $112,580$ (implicit sentence, explicit sentence) pairs. We validate ImpScore through a user study that compares its assessments with human evaluations on out-of-distribution data, demonstrating its accuracy and strong correlation with human judgments. Additionally, we apply ImpScore to hate speech detection datasets, illustrating its utility and highlighting significant limitations in current large language models' ability to understand highly implicit content.</description>

      <title>Q-SFT: Q-Learning for Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Value-based reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle learn effective policies for a wide range of multi-turn problems, from games to dialogue to robotic control, including via offline RL from static previously collected datasets. However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to train large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering), value-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have proven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language models. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In this way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the likelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function during finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying performance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in practice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this, our approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models, without the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without the need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages. Empirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a variety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic manipulation and navigation from images.</description>

Abstract: Rapid ice recession in the Arctic Ocean, with predictions of ice-free summers by 2060, opens new maritime routes but requires reliable navigation solutions. Current approaches rely heavily on subjective expert judgment, underscoring the need for automated, data-driven solutions. This study leverages machine learning to assess ice conditions using ship-borne optical data, introducing a finely annotated dataset of 946 images, and a semi-manual, region-based annotation technique. The proposed video segmentation model, UPerFlow, advances the SegFlow architecture by incorporating a six-channel ResNet encoder, two UPerNet-based segmentation decoders for each image, PWCNet as the optical flow encoder, and cross-connections that integrate bi-directional flow features without loss of latent information. The proposed architecture outperforms baseline image segmentation networks by an average 38% in occluded regions, demonstrating the robustness of video segmentation in addressing challenging Arctic conditions.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

Abstract: Recently a one-dimensional Schwarzian type theory was proposed as an effective dual theory of pure gravity in (2+1) dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes \cite{Bhattacharjee:2023sfd}. This codimension-two `celestial' dual captures the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of bulk flat cosmologies in semiclassical limit. In this paper, we extend this analysis beyond semiclassical approximation and evaluate the one-loop exact partition function of this celestial dual theory. Our analysis results in novel nontrivial logarithmic corrections to the area term of entropy, appearing from the one-loop path integral.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>

      <title>IOPO: Empowering LLMs with Complex Instruction Following via Input-Output Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.</description>

      <title>Self-Training Meets Consistency: Improving LLMs' Reasoning With Consistency-Driven Rationale Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-training approach for large language models (LLMs) improves reasoning abilities by training the models on their self-generated rationales. Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian band structures, exceptional points generically form gapless lines or loops that give rise to extensively many defective eigenstates. In this work, we investigate how they non-trivially contribute to higher-order nonlinear responses by introducing unique singularities in the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) or Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Using a tilted 2D dissipative Dirac model ansatz that harbors an exceptional ring, broken inversion symmetry is shown to give rise to extrinsic (BCD) and intrinsic (BCP) nonlinear Hall behaviors unique to systems with extensive exceptional singularities. In particular, when the non-Hermiticity is increased while keeping the ring radius fixed, the BCD response exhibits a power-law increase, while the BCP response correspondingly decreases. Our work sheds light on how non-Hermiticity can qualitatively control the extent and nature of higher harmonic generation in solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end speech recognition, combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries during decoding. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>

      <title>Purcell Rate Suppressing in a Novel Design of Qubit Readout Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Purcell effect, a common issue in qubit-resonator systems leading to fidelity loss is studied while its suppression is achieved using a novel qubit readout circuit design. Our approach utilizes a unique coupling architecture in which, the qubit first interacts with a filter resonator before linking to the readout resonator. This configuration enables precise control over the Purcell decay rate and ac Stark factor without impacting on measuring time. The mentioned factor is highly sensitive to the coupling strength between the readout resonator and the filter, meaning that the factor adjustment directly impacts the qubit state detection. A major advantage of this design is that tuning the resonator-filter coupling strength is relatively straightforward, offering flexibility in fine-tuning ac Stark factor.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>ViTOC: Vision Transformer and Object-aware Captioner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents ViTOC (Vision Transformer and Object-aware Captioner), a novel vision-language model for image captioning that addresses the challenges of accuracy and diversity in generated descriptions. Unlike conventional approaches, ViTOC employs a dual-path architecture based on Vision Transformer and object detector, effectively fusing global visual features and local object information through learnable vectors. The model introduces an innovative object-aware prompting strategy that significantly enhances its capability in handling long-tail data. Experiments on the standard COCO dataset demonstrate that ViTOC outperforms baseline models across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation method based on CLIP to further validate the model's effectiveness. By utilizing pretrained visual model parameters, ViTOC achieves efficient end-to-end training.</description>

      <title>Exact large $N$ expansion of mass deformed ABJM theory on squashed sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the partition function of the mass deformed ABJM theory on a squashed three sphere. In particular, we focus on the case with the Chern-Simons levels being $\pm 1$ and apply a duality between this theory and the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{U}\left(N\right)$ super Yang-Mills theory with an adjoint hypermultiplet and a fundamental hypermultiplet. For a special mass parameter depending on the squashing parameter, we find that the partition function can be written as that of an ideal Fermi gas with a non-trivial density matrix. By studying this density matrix, we analytically derive the all order perturbative expansion of the partition function in $1/N$, which turns out to take the form of the Airy function. Our results not only align with previous findings and conjectures but also lead to a new formula for the overall constant factor of the partition function. We also study the exact values of the partition function for small but finite values of $N$.</description>

      <title>Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Differential Privacy over Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models (FMs) on distributed edge devices presents considerable computational and privacy challenges. Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) mitigates some privacy issues by facilitating collaborative model training without the need to share raw data. To lessen the computational burden on resource-limited devices, combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Additionally, the split FedFT architecture partitions an FM between edge devices and a central server, reducing the necessity for complete model deployment on individual devices. However, the risk of privacy eavesdropping attacks in FedFT remains a concern, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare and finance. In this paper, we propose a split FedFT framework with differential privacy (DP) over wireless networks, where the inherent wireless channel noise in the uplink transmission is utilized to achieve DP guarantees without adding an extra artificial noise. We shall investigate the impact of the wireless noise on convergence performance of the proposed framework. We will also show that by updating only one of the low-rank matrices in the split FedFT with DP, the proposed method can mitigate the noise amplification effect. Simulation results will demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy under strict privacy budgets compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.</description>

      <title>DINO-LG: A Task-Specific DINO Model for Coronary Calcium Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07976v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitates effective risk assessment strategies, with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring via computed tomography (CT) being a key method for prevention. Traditional methods, primarily based on UNET architectures implemented on pre-built models, face challenges like the scarcity of annotated CT scans containing CAC and imbalanced datasets, leading to reduced performance in segmentation and scoring tasks. In this study, we address these limitations by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels), which trains without requiring CAC-specific annotations, enhancing its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO-LG model, which leverages label guidance to focus on calcified areas, achieves significant improvements, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 90% for detecting CAC-containing CT slices, compared to the standard DINO model's sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 77%. Additionally, false-negative and false-positive rates are reduced by 49% and 59%, respectively, instilling greater confidence in clinicians when ruling out calcification in low-risk patients and minimizing unnecessary imaging reviews by radiologists. Further, CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are conducted using a basic UNET architecture, applied specifically to CT slices identified by the DINO-LG model as containing calcified areas. This targeted approach enhances CAC scoring accuracy by feeding the UNET model with relevant slices, significantly improving diagnostic precision, reducing both false positives and false negatives, and ultimately lowering overall healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary tests and treatments, presenting a valuable advancement in CAD risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun. The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the properties of the particle event. Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun. Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the front side and far side of the Sun as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta \phi, the separation in longitude between the source active region and the magnetic footpoint of the observing spacecraft based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy &gt;10 MeV measured by the STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES spacecraft at 1 au. We also considered the occurrence of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry in the detection of &gt;10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; -40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; +180. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, given that for events with \Delta \phi &lt; 0 corotation sweeps the particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta \phi &gt; 0 it takes them away from it.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration via Transient Stagnation Surfaces in MADs During Flux Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the simulation of accretion processes in Magnetically Arrested Disks (MADs) and investigate the dynamics of plasma during flux eruption events.
  We employ general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and search for regions with a divergent velocity during a flux eruption event. These regions would experience rapid and significant depletion of matter. For this reason, we monitor the activation rate of the floor and the mass supply required for stable simulation evolution to further trace this transient stagnation surface.
  Our findings reveal an unexpected and persistent stagnation surface that develops during these eruptions, located around 2-3 gravitational radii (${\rm r_g}$) from the black hole. The stagnation surface is defined by a divergent velocity field and is accompanied by enhanced mass addition. This represents the first report of such a feature in this context. The stagnation surface is ($7-9\,\,{\rm r_g}$) long. We estimate the overall potential difference along this stagnation surface for a supermassive black hole like M87 to be approximately $\Delta V \approx 10^{16}$ Volts.
  Our results indicate that, in MAD configurations, this transient stagnation surface during flux eruption events can be associated with an accelerator of charged particles in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. In light of magnetic reconnection processes during these events, this work presents a complementary or an alternative mechanism for particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

Abstract: Vaccination is widely recognised as one of the most effective forms of public health interventions. Individuals decisions regarding vaccination creates a complex social dilemma between individual and collective interests, where each person's decision affects the overall public health outcome. In this paper, we study the adaptive dynamics for the evolutionary dynamics of strategies in a fundamental game-theoretic model of vaticination. We show the existence of an (Nash) equilibrium and analyse the stability and bifurcations when varying the relevant parameters. We also demonstrate our analytical results by several concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Superconnections in AdS/QCD and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

Abstract: The year 2022 marks a watershed in technology, and arguably in human history, with the release of powerful generative AIs capable of convincingly performing creative tasks. With the help of these systems, anyone can create something that would previously have been considered a remarkable work of art. In human-AI collaboration, the computer seems to have become more than a tool. Many who have made their first contact with current generative AIs see them as "creativity machines" while for others the term "machine creativity" remains an oxymoron. This article is about (the possibility of) creativity in computers within the current Machine Learning paradigm. It outlines some of the key concepts behind the technologies and the innovations that have contributed to this qualitative shift, with a focus on text-to-image systems. The nature of Artificial Creativity as such is discussed, as well as what this might mean for art. AI may become a responsible collaborator with elements of independent machine authorship in the artistic process.</description>

      <title>Random feature baselines provide distributional performance and feature selection benchmarks for clinical and 'omic machine learning</title>

Abstract: Identifying predictive features from high-dimensional datasets is a major task in biomedical research. However, it is difficult to determine the robustness of selected features. Here, we investigate the performance of randomly chosen features, what we term "random feature baselines" (RFBs), in the context of disease risk prediction from blood plasma proteomics data in the UK Biobank. We examine two published case studies predicting diagnosis of (1) dementia and (2) hip fracture. RFBs perform similarly to published proteins of interest (using the same number, randomly chosen). We then measure the performance of RFBs for all 607 disease outcomes in the UK Biobank, with various numbers of randomly chosen features, as well as all proteins in the dataset. 114/607 outcomes showed a higher mean AUROC when choosing 5 random features than using all proteins, and the absolute difference in mean AUC was 0.075. 163 outcomes showed a higher mean AUROC when choosing 1000 random features than using all proteins, and the absolute difference in mean AUC was 0.03. Incorporating RFBs should become part of ML practice when feature selection or target discovery is a goal.</description>

      <title>Stellar Halos of Bright Central Galaxies: A View from the FEGA Semi-Analytic Model of Galaxy Formation and VEGAS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions and extrapolations from observed data of the stellar halos surrounding central group/cluster galaxies and the transition radius between them and the intracluster or diffuse light. Leveraging the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, {\small FEGA} (\citealt{contini2024c}), applied to two dark matter-only cosmological simulations, we derive both the stellar halo mass and its radius. Using theoretical assumptions about the diffuse light distribution and halo concentration, we extrapolate the same information for observed data from the {\small VEGAS} survey (\citealt{capaccioli2015,iodice2021}). Our model, supported by observational data and independent simulation results, predicts an increasing transition radius with halo mass, a constant stellar halo-to-intracluster light ratio, and a stable stellar halo mass fraction with increasing halo mass. Specifically, we find that the transition radius between the stellar halo and the diffuse light ranges from 20 to 250 kpc, from Milky Way-like halos to large clusters, while the stellar halo mass comprises only a small fraction, between 7\% and 18\%, of the total stellar mass within the virial radius. These results support the idea that the stellar halo can be viewed as a transition region between the stars bound to the galaxy and those belonging to the intracluster light, consistent with recent observations and theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC): A Theoretical and Computational Approach to Enhance Second Language Pronunciation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learners of a second language (L2) often unconsciously substitute unfamiliar L2 phonemes with similar phonemes from their native language (L1), even though native speakers of the L2 perceive these sounds as distinct and non-interchangeable. This phonemic substitution leads to deviations from the standard phonological patterns of the L2, creating challenges for learners in acquiring accurate L2 pronunciation. To address this, we propose Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a novel computational method designed to minimize incorrect phonological transfer by reconstructing L2 phonemes as composite sounds derived from multiple L1 phonemes. Tests with two automatic speech recognition models demonstrated that when L2 speakers produced IPC-generated composite sounds, the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes improved by 20% compared to when their pronunciation was influenced by original phonological transfer patterns. The improvement was observed within a relatively shorter time frame, demonstrating rapid acquisition of the composite sound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore an approach to actively plan and excite contact modes in differentiable simulators as a means to tighten the sim-to-real gap. We propose an optimal experimental design approach derived from information-theoretic methods to identify and search for information-rich contact modes through the use of contact-implicit optimization. We demonstrate our approach on a robot parameter estimation problem with unknown inertial and kinematic parameters which actively seeks contacts with a nearby surface. We show that our approach improves the identification of unknown parameter estimates over experimental runs by an estimate error reduction of at least $\sim 84\%$ when compared to a random sampling baseline, with significantly higher information gains.</description>

      <title>STOP: Spatiotemporal Orthogonal Propagation for Weight-Threshold-Leakage Synergistic Training of Deep Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevailing of artificial intelligence-of-things calls for higher energy-efficient edge computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic agents leveraging brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) models based on spatiotemporally sparse binary spikes. However, the lack of efficient and high-accuracy deep SNN learning algorithms prevents them from practical edge deployments at a strictly bounded cost. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal orthogonal propagation (STOP) algorithm to tackle this challenge. Our algorithm enables fully synergistic learning of synaptic weights as well as firing thresholds and leakage factors in spiking neurons to improve SNN accuracy, in a unified temporally-forward trace-based framework to mitigate the huge memory requirement for storing neural states across all time-steps in the forward pass. Characteristically, the spatially-backward neuronal errors and temporally-forward traces propagate orthogonally to and independently of each other, substantially reducing computational complexity. Our STOP algorithm obtained high recognition accuracies of 94.84%, 74.92%, 98.26% and 77.10% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets with adequate deep convolutional SNNs of VGG-11 or ResNet-18 structures. Compared with other deep SNN training algorithms, our method is more plausible for edge intelligent scenarios where resources are limited but high-accuracy in-situ learning is desired.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet Problem For the Logarithmic p-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian $L_{\Delta_p}$, which emerges from the formal derivative of the fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta_p)^s$ at $s=0$. This operator is nonlocal, has logarithmic order, and is the nonlinear version of the newly developed logarithmic Laplacian operator. We present a variational framework to study the Dirichlet problems involving the $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains. This allows us to investigate the connection between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the fractional $p$-Laplacian and the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian. As a consequence, we deduce a Faber-Krahn inequality for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. We discuss maximum and comparison principles for $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains and demonstrate that the validity of these depends on the sign of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. In addition, we prove that the first Dirichlet eigenfunction of $L_{\Delta_p}$ is bounded. Furthermore, we establish a boundary Hardy-type inequality for the spaces associated with the weak formulation of the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Massive neutrinos, Anomalous magnetic moments and Dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amongst the issues plaguing the Standard Model (SM) are questions pertaining to neutrino masses and mixings, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and muon and the problem of a suitable dark matter (DM) candidate. All the three issues can be addressed at once by extending the SM with two generations of vector-like fermions and an inert scalar doublet, all odd under a Z2 symmetry. The light neutrino masses and mixings are generated radiatively while maintaining consistency with bounds on lepton flavor violation. Loop diagrams with the very same fields also serve to explain the anomalous magnetic moments. Similarly, the correct dark matter relic abundance is reproduced without coming into conflict with direct detection constraints, or those from big bang nucleosynthesis or the cosmic microwave observations. Finally, prospective signatures at the LHC are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scalable Autoregressive Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that the autoregressive model is an effective and scalable monocular depth estimator. Our idea is simple: We tackle the monocular depth estimation (MDE) task with an autoregressive prediction paradigm, based on two core designs. First, our depth autoregressive model (DAR) treats the depth map of different resolutions as a set of tokens, and conducts the low-to-high resolution autoregressive objective with a patch-wise casual mask. Second, our DAR recursively discretizes the entire depth range into more compact intervals, and attains the coarse-to-fine granularity autoregressive objective in an ordinal-regression manner. By coupling these two autoregressive objectives, our DAR establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on KITTI and NYU Depth v2 by clear margins. Further, our scalable approach allows us to scale the model up to 2.0B and achieve the best RMSE of 1.799 on the KITTI dataset (5% improvement) compared to 1.896 by the current SOTA (Depth Anything). DAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability on unseen datasets. These results suggest that DAR yields superior performance with an autoregressive prediction paradigm, providing a promising approach to equip modern autoregressive large models (e.g., GPT-4o) with depth estimation capabilities.</description>

      <title>CLUE-MARK: Watermarking Diffusion Models using CLWE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI-generated images become widespread, reliable watermarking is essential for content verification, copyright enforcement, and combating disinformation. Existing techniques rely on heuristic approaches and lack formal guarantees of undetectability, making them vulnerable to steganographic attacks that can expose or erase the watermark. Additionally, these techniques often degrade output quality by introducing perceptible changes, which is not only undesirable but an important barrier to adoption in practice.
  In this work, we introduce CLUE-Mark, the first provably undetectable watermarking scheme for diffusion models. CLUE-Mark requires no changes to the model being watermarked, is computationally efficient, and because it is provably undetectable is guaranteed to have no impact on model output quality. Our approach leverages the Continuous Learning With Errors (CLWE) problem -- a cryptographically hard lattice problem -- to embed watermarks in the latent noise vectors used by diffusion models. By proving undetectability via reduction from a cryptographically hard problem we ensure not only that the watermark is imperceptible to human observers or adhoc heuristics, but to \emph{any} efficient detector that does not have the secret key. CLUE-Mark allows multiple keys to be embedded, enabling traceability of images to specific users without altering model parameters. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art diffusion models confirm that CLUE-Mark achieves high recoverability, preserves image quality, and is robust to minor perturbations such JPEG compression and brightness adjustments. Uniquely, CLUE-Mark cannot be detected nor removed by recent steganographic attacks.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs) that accounts for a dynamical accumulation of charge in the reservoirs. As a consequence, heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs, as well as provide insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

      <title>Moderate Influence of Halo Spin on Stellar Mass Distributions in Dwarf and Massive Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate halo spins for HI-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey using a semi-analytic approach, examining the relationship between halo spin and stellar surface density. Our findings reveal an inverse correlation in both low- and high-mass galaxy samples, with stellar surface density decreasing as halo spin increases. This trend highlights the pivotal role of halo spin in galaxy evolution and suggests a universal formation scenario: high-spin halos, accompanied by high-spin accreted gas, retain angular momentum, preventing gas from efficiently condensing in the galactic center and thus suppressing star formation. Consequently, weak feedback redistributes gas to the halo outskirts without significant expulsion. The shallower central gravitational potential in high-spin halos promotes outward stellar migration, leading to more extended stellar distributions and lower stellar surface densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Yanyan Li and Xukai Yan showed the following interesting Hardy inequalities with anisotropic weights: Let $n\geq 2$, $p \geq 1$, $p\alpha &gt; 1-n$, $p(\alpha + \beta)&gt; -n$, then there exists $C &gt; 0$ such that $$\||x|^{\beta}|x'|^{\alpha+1} \nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)} \geq C\||x|^\beta|x'|^\alpha u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \quad \forall\; u\in C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ Here $x' = (x_1,\ldots, x_{n-1}, 0)$ for $x = (x_i) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. In this note, we will determine the best constant for the above estimate when $p=2$ or $\beta \geq 0$. Moreover, as refinement for very special case of Li-Yan's result in Adv. Math. 2023, we provide explicit estimate for the anisotropic $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

      <title>Breathless: An 8-hour Performance Contrasting Human and Robot Expressiveness</title>

Abstract: This paper describes the robot technology behind an original performance that pairs a human dancer (Cuan) with an industrial robot arm for an eight-hour dance that unfolds over the timespan of an American workday. To control the robot arm, we combine a range of sinusoidal motions with varying amplitude, frequency and offset at each joint to evoke human motions common in physical labor such as stirring, digging, and stacking. More motions were developed using deep learning techniques for video-based human-pose tracking and extraction. We combine these pre-recorded motions with improvised robot motions created live by putting the robot into teach-mode and triggering force sensing from the robot joints onstage. All motions are combined with commercial and original music using a custom suite of python software with AppleScript, Keynote, and Zoom to facilitate on-stage communication with the dancer. The resulting performance contrasts the expressivity of the human body with the precision of robot machinery.

      <title>Combinational Backdoor Attack against Customized Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis technology has made tremendous strides. Numerous representative T2I models have emerged and achieved promising application outcomes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, etc. In practice, it has become increasingly popular for model developers to selectively adopt various pre-trained text encoders and conditional diffusion models from third-party platforms, integrating them to build customized (personalized) T2I models. However, such an adoption approach is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. In this work, we propose a Combinational Backdoor Attack against Customized T2I models (CBACT2I) targeting this application scenario. Different from previous backdoor attacks against T2I models, CBACT2I embeds the backdoor into the text encoder and the conditional diffusion model separately. The customized T2I model exhibits backdoor behaviors only when the backdoor text encoder is used in combination with the backdoor conditional diffusion model. These properties make CBACT2I more stealthy and flexible than prior backdoor attacks against T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CBACT2I with different backdoor triggers and different backdoor targets on the open-sourced Stable Diffusion model. This work reveals the backdoor vulnerabilities of customized T2I models and urges countermeasures to mitigate backdoor threats in this scenario.</description>

      <title>New insight into the orbital parameters of the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057 consists of a Be star and an undetected compact object in a $\sim$317 day orbit. The interpretation of the emission from this system is complicated by the lack of a clear orbital solution, as two different and incompatible orbital solutions were obtained by previous radial velocity studies of this source. In order to address this, we report on 24 new observations, covering $\sim$60 per cent of the orbit which we have undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We obtained new radial velocity measurements from cross-correlation of the narrower spectral features, and by fitting Voigt profiles to the wings of the Balmer emission lines. Additionally, we find an indication of orbital variability in the equivalent widths and V/R of the Balmer lines. Using the combined data from this study, as well as archival data from the earlier radial velocity studies, we have derived updated orbital solutions. Using reported H $\alpha$ emission radial velocities - previously not considered for the orbital solution - along with the new SALT data, a solution is obtained where the brighter peak in the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves is closer to periastron. However, continuing sparse coverage in the data around the expected phases of periastron indicates that the orbital solution could be improved with further observation.</description>

      <title>Playing Language Game with LLMs Leads to Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of numerous jailbreak techniques aimed at circumventing their security defenses against malicious attacks. An effective jailbreak approach is to identify a domain where safety generalization fails, a phenomenon known as mismatched generalization. In this paper, we introduce two novel jailbreak methods based on mismatched generalization: natural language games and custom language games, both of which effectively bypass the safety mechanisms of LLMs, with various kinds and different variants, making them hard to defend and leading to high attack rates. Natural language games involve the use of synthetic linguistic constructs and the actions intertwined with these constructs, such as the Ubbi Dubbi language. Building on this phenomenon, we propose the custom language games method: by engaging with LLMs using a variety of custom rules, we successfully execute jailbreak attacks across multiple LLM platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, achieving success rates of 93% on GPT-4o, 89% on GPT-4o-mini and 83% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Furthermore, to investigate the generalizability of safety alignments, we fine-tuned Llama-3.1-70B with the custom language games to achieve safety alignment within our datasets and found that when interacting through other language games, the fine-tuned models still failed to identify harmful content. This finding indicates that the safety alignment knowledge embedded in LLMs fails to generalize across different linguistic formats, thus opening new avenues for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Kicking the Tires on Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2 \times 10^{-16} M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12} M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 2 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Closer Look at Efficient Inference Methods: A Survey of Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient inference in large language models (LLMs) has become a critical focus as their scale and complexity grow. Traditional autoregressive decoding, while effective, suffers from computational inefficiencies due to its sequential token generation process. Speculative decoding addresses this bottleneck by introducing a two-stage framework: drafting and verification. A smaller, efficient model generates a preliminary draft, which is then refined by a larger, more sophisticated model. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of speculative decoding methods, categorizing them into draft-centric and model-centric approaches. We discuss key ideas associated with each method, highlighting their potential for scaling LLM inference. This survey aims to guide future research in optimizing speculative decoding and its integration into real-world LLM applications.</description>

      <title>On the structure of normalized models of circular-arc graphs -- Hsu's approach revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle. The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs. Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs. We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph. We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time. Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.
  We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs. However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is incorrect. Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational decoherence of a mechanical oscillator from spacetime fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

      <title>uRWELL detector developments at Jefferson Lab for high luminosity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the future plans at Jefferson Lab is running electron scattering experiments with large acceptance detectors at luminosities $&gt; 10^{37}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. These experiments allow the measurements of the Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) reaction, an important physics process in the formalism of Generalized Parton Distributions, which has never been measured because of its small cross-section. The luminosity upgrade of CLAS12 or the SOLID detector makes Jefferson Lab a unique place to measure DDVCS. One of the important components of these high luminosity detectors is a tracking system that can withstand high rates of $\approx 1MHz/cm^{2}$. The recently developed Micro-Resistive Well (uRWELL) detector technology is a promising option for such a tracking detector by combining good position resolutions, low material budget with simple mechanical construction, and low production costs. In this proceeding, we will discuss recent developments and studies with uRWELL detectors at Jefferson Lab for future upgrades of the CLAS12 detector to study the DDVCS reaction.</description>

      <title>Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks Optimization with Causal Message-passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discover that causal inference provides a promising approach to capture heterophilic message-passing in Graph Neural Network (GNN). By leveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on asymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate relationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce intervention-based causal inference in graph learning. We first simplify causal analysis on graphs by formulating it as a structural learning model and define the optimization problem within the Bayesian scheme. We then present an analysis of decomposing the optimization target into a consistency penalty and a structure modification based on cause-effect relations. We then estimate this target by conditional entropy and present insights into how conditional entropy quantifies the heterophily. Accordingly, we propose CausalMP, a causal message-passing discovery network for heterophilic graph learning, that iteratively learns the explicit causal structure of input graphs. We conduct extensive experiments in both heterophilic and homophilic graph settings. The result demonstrates that the our model achieves superior link prediction performance. Training on causal structure can also enhance node representation in classification task across different base models.</description>

      <title>Image Compression Using Novel View Synthesis Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time visual feedback is essential for tetherless control of remotely operated vehicles, particularly during inspection and manipulation tasks. Though acoustic communication is the preferred choice for medium-range communication underwater, its limited bandwidth renders it impractical to transmit images or videos in real-time. To address this, we propose a model-based image compression technique that leverages prior mission information. Our approach employs trained machine-learning based novel view synthesis models, and uses gradient descent optimization to refine latent representations to help generate compressible differences between camera images and rendered images. We evaluate the proposed compression technique using a dataset from an artificial ocean basin, demonstrating superior compression ratios and image quality over existing techniques. Moreover, our method exhibits robustness to introduction of new objects within the scene, highlighting its potential for advancing tetherless remotely operated vehicle operations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of hidden-charm pentaquarks as triangle singularities via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the nature of near-threshold enhancements is hindered by the limited resolution of experimental data leading to multiple conflicting interpretations. A prominent example of ambiguous line shape is the set of pentaquark signals observed by LHCb in 2019. Some of these signals can be interpreted as hadronic molecule, compact state, virtual state, or due to a kinematical triangle mechanism. In this work, we leverage the model-selection capability of deep neural networks to analyze and identify the nature of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$. We trained a set of deep neural networks using line shapes with enhancements produced by triangle singularities and those produced by nearby poles. The training dataset for the triangle enhancements are generated by using a set of hadrons satisfying the required mass condition. The training line shapes for the pole-based classifications are generated using uniformized independent $S$-matrix poles configured to appear close to the relevant threshold. We found that, despite the presence of experimental uncertainties, the triangle mechanism is ruled out by the experimental data. The results also suggest that the data favor the pole-shadow pair interpretation for the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$, which corresponds to a characteristic pole structure involving a resonance in a two-channel scattering system. Our result is consistent with the initial analysis done by LHCb favoring the Breit-Wigner fit over the triangle singularity. The present analysis offers an alternative approach to studying line shapes, supplementing the standard fitting methods.</description>

      <title>CKTSO: High-Performance Parallel Sparse Linear Solver for General Circuit Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces CKTSO (abbreviation of "circuit solver"), a novel sparse linear solver specially designed for the simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE). CKTSO is a parallel solver and can be run on a multi-core, shared-memory computer. The algorithms of CKTSO are designed by considering the features of matrices involved in SPICE simulations. CKTSO is superior to existing similar solvers mainly in the following three aspects. First, the matrix ordering step of CKTSO combines different types of ordering algorithms such that it can generally obtain the fewest fill-ins for a wide range of circuit matrices. Second, CKTSO provides a parallel fast LU factorization algorithm with pivot check, which behaves good performance, scalability, and numerical stability. Third, CKTSO provides a structure-adaptive hybrid parallel triangular solving algorithm, which can adapt to various circuit matrices. Experiments including both benchmark tests and SPICE simulations demonstrate the superior performance of CKTSO. The libraries of CKTSO are available at https://github.com/chenxm1986/cktso.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>

Abstract: Parameter inference is a crucial task in modern cosmology that requires accurate and fast computational methods to handle the high precision and volume of observational datasets. In this study, we explore a hybrid vision transformer, the Convolution vision Transformer (CvT), which combines the benefits of vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use this approach to infer the $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameters from simulated dark matter and halo fields. Our experiments indicate that the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ obtained using CvT are better than ViT and CNN, using either dark matter or halo fields. For CvT, pretraining on dark matter fields proves advantageous for improving constraints using halo fields compared to training a model from the beginning. However, ViT and CNN do not show these benefits. The CvT is more efficient than ViT since, despite having more parameters, it requires a training time similar to that of ViT and has similar inference times. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Yash-10/cvt-cosmo-inference/}.</description>

      <title>Rising Rested Bandits: Lower Bounds and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is in the field of stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), i.e. those sequential selection techniques able to learn online using only the feedback given by the chosen option (a.k.a. $arm$). We study a particular case of the rested bandits in which the arms' expected reward is monotonically non-decreasing and concave. We study the inherent sample complexity of the regret minimization problem by deriving suitable regret lower bounds. Then, we design an algorithm for the rested case $\textit{R-ed-UCB}$, providing a regret bound depending on the properties of the instance and, under certain circumstances, of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. We empirically compare our algorithms with state-of-the-art methods for non-stationary MABs over several synthetically generated tasks and an online model selection problem for a real-world dataset</description>

      <title>Initial Evidence of Elevated Reconnaissance Attacks Against Nodes in P2P Overlay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We hypothesize that peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network nodes can be attractive to attackers due to their visibility, sustained uptime, and resource potential. Towards validating this hypothesis, we investigate the state of active reconnaissance attacks on Ethereum P2P network nodes by deploying a series of honeypots alongside actual Ethereum nodes across globally distributed vantage points. We find that Ethereum nodes experience not only increased attacks, but also specific types of attacks targeting particular ports and services. Furthermore, we find evidence that the threat assessment on our nodes is applicable to the wider P2P network by having performed port scans on other reachable peers. Our findings provide insights into potential mitigation strategies to improve the security of the P2P networking layer.</description>

      <title>Diversification quotient based on expectiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diversification quotient (DQ) quantifies diversification in stochastic portfolio models based on a family of risk measures. We study DQ based on expectiles, offering a useful alternative to conventional risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). The expectile-based DQ admits simple formulas and has a natural connection to the Omega ratio. Moreover, the expectile-based DQ is not affected by small-sample issues faced by VaR-based or ES-based DQ due to the scarcity of tail data. The expectile-based DQ exhibits pseudo-convexity in portfolio weights, allowing gradient descent algorithms for portfolio selection. We show that the corresponding optimization problem can be efficiently solved using linear programming techniques in real-data applications. Explicit formulas for DQ based on expectiles are also derived for elliptical and multivariate regularly varying distribution models. Our findings enhance the understanding of the DQ's role in financial risk management and highlight its potential to improve portfolio construction strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Future of Exoplanets: Asteroseismic Confirmation of Subgiant and Red Giant Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes ($\Delta\Pi_{1}$), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars' evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding future weather changes at regional and local scales is crucial for planning and decision-making, particularly in the context of extreme weather events, as well as for broader applications in agriculture, insurance, and infrastructure development. However, the computational cost of downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) to the fine resolutions needed for such applications presents a significant barrier. Drawing on advancements in weather forecasting models, this study introduces a cost-efficient downscaling method using a pretrained Earth Vision Transformer (Earth ViT) model. Initially trained on ERA5 data to downscale from 50 km to 25 km resolution, the model is then tested on the higher resolution BARRA-SY dataset at a 3 km resolution. Remarkably, it performs well without additional training, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different resolutions. This approach holds promise for generating large ensembles of regional climate simulations by downscaling GCMs with varying input resolutions without incurring additional training costs. Ultimately, this method could provide more comprehensive estimates of potential future changes in key climate variables, aiding in effective planning for extreme weather events and climate change adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Uncertain standard quadratic optimization under distributional assumptions: a chance-constrained epigraphic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard quadratic optimization problem (StQP) consists of minimizing a quadratic form over the standard simplex. Without convexity or concavity of the quadratic form, the StQP is NP-hard. This problem has many relevant real-life applications ranging portfolio optimization to pairwise clustering and replicator dynamics. Sometimes, the data matrix is uncertain. We investigate models where the distribution of the data matrix is known but where both the StQP after realization of the data matrix and the here-and-now problem are indefinite. We test the performance of a chance-constrained epigraphic StQP to the uncertain StQP.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large systems are often coarse-grained in order to study their low-dimensional macroscopic dynamics, yet microscopic complexity can in principle disrupt these predictions in many ways. We first consider one form of fine-grained complexity, heterogeneity in the time scales of microscopic dynamics, and show by an algebraic approach that it can stabilize macroscopic degrees of freedom. We then show that this time scale heterogeneity can arise from other forms of complexity, in particular disordered interactions between microscopic variables, and that it can drive the system's coarse-grained dynamics to transition from nonequilibrium attractors to fixed points. These mechanisms are demonstrated in a model of many-species ecosystems, where we find a quasi-decoupling between the low- and high-dimensional facets of the dynamics, interacting only through a key feature of ecological models, the fact that species' dynamical time scales are controlled by their abundances. We conclude that fine-grained disorder may enable a macroscopic equilibrium description of many-species ecosystems.</description>

      <title>XGrammar: Flexible and Efficient Structured Generation Engine for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Measurements with the Photon Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the universal symmetries of the black hole photon ring in a wide range of non-Kerr spacetimes, including the Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Sen, Kerr-Bardeen, and Kerr-Hayward metrics. The demagnification exponent ($\gamma$) controls the size and flux scaling of higher-order images, which appear in the photon ring, the time delay ($\tau$) determines the timing of their appearance, and the rotation parameter ($\delta$) relates their relative orientations on the image plane. Our investigation reveals distinct responses of these critical parameters to black hole spin, generalized charge, and observer inclination: $\gamma$ is predominantly influenced by charge and spin, $\tau$ is strongly affected by inclination, especially for near-extremal black holes, and $\delta$ is highly sensitive to spin. Notably, we find that the time delay provides an independent constraint on shadow size for polar observers, while the rotation parameter facilitates metric-independent spin measurements. Specifically, for Kerr black holes, the total variation in $\gamma$, $\tau$, and $\delta$ across all possible inclinations is $\lesssim 10\%$, $\lesssim 20\%$, and $\lesssim 60\%$, respectively. By contrast, the Kerr shadow size varies by only $\lesssim 8\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an aim towards modeling cosmologies beyond the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, we demonstrate the automatic construction of recombination history emulators while enforcing a prior of causal dynamics. These methods are particularly useful in the current era of precision cosmology, where extremely constraining datasets provide insights into a cosmological model dominated by unknown contents. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in particular provide a clean glimpse into the interaction of dark matter, baryons, and radiation in the early Universe, but interpretation of this data requires knowledge of the Universe's ionization history. The exploration of new physics with new CMB data will require fast and flexible calculation of this ionization history. We develop a differentiable machine learning model for recombination physics using a neural network ordinary differential equation architecture (Universal Differential Equations, UDEs), building towards automatic dimensionality reduction and the avoidance of manual tuning based on cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Watermark-Based Defense Mechanisms in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Unauthorized Data Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have shown exceptional potential in generating high-quality images. However, recent studies highlight concerns over the use of unauthorized data in training these models, which may lead to intellectual property infringement or privacy violations. A promising approach to mitigate these issues is to apply a watermark to images and subsequently check if generative models reproduce similar watermark features. In this paper, we examine the robustness of various watermark-based protection methods applied to text-to-image models. We observe that common image transformations are ineffective at removing the watermark effect. Therefore, we propose RATTAN, that leverages the diffusion process to conduct controlled image generation on the protected input, preserving the high-level features of the input while ignoring the low-level details utilized by watermarks. A small number of generated images are then used to fine-tune protected models. Our experiments on three datasets and 140 text-to-image diffusion models reveal that existing state-of-the-art protections are not robust against RATTAN.</description>

      <title>Measuring Compliance of Consent Revocation on the Web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GDPR requires websites to facilitate the right to revoke consent from Web users. While numerous studies measured compliance of consent with the various consent requirements, no prior work has studied consent revocation on the Web. Therefore, it remains unclear how difficult it is to revoke consent on the websites' interfaces, nor whether revoked consent is properly stored and communicated behind the user interface. Our work aims to fill this gap by measuring compliance of consent revocation on the Web on the top-200 websites. We found that 19.87% of websites make it difficult for users to revoke consent throughout different interfaces, 20.5% of websites require more effort than acceptance, and 2.48% do not provide consent revocation at all, thus violating legal requirements for valid consent. 57.5% websites do not delete the cookies after consent revocation enabling continuous illegal processing of users' data. Moreover, we analyzed 281 websites implementing the IAB Europe TCF, and found 22 websites that store a positive consent despite user's revocation. Surprisingly, we found that on 101 websites, third parties that have received consent upon user's acceptance, are not informed of user's revocation, leading to the illegal processing of users' data by such third parties. Our findings emphasise the need for improved legal compliance of consent revocation, and proper, consistent, and uniform implementation of revocation communication and data deletion practices.</description>

      <title>OphCLIP: Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Ophthalmic Surgical Video-Language Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical practice involves complex visual interpretation, procedural skills, and advanced medical knowledge, making surgical vision-language pretraining (VLP) particularly challenging due to this complexity and the limited availability of annotated data. To address the gap, we propose OphCLIP, a hierarchical retrieval-augmented vision-language pretraining framework specifically designed for ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. OphCLIP leverages the OphVL dataset we constructed, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of over 375K hierarchically structured video-text pairs with tens of thousands of different combinations of attributes (surgeries, phases/operations/actions, instruments, medications, as well as more advanced aspects like the causes of eye diseases, surgical objectives, and postoperative recovery recommendations, etc). These hierarchical video-text correspondences enable OphCLIP to learn both fine-grained and long-term visual representations by aligning short video clips with detailed narrative descriptions and full videos with structured titles, capturing intricate surgical details and high-level procedural insights, respectively. Our OphCLIP also designs a retrieval-augmented pretraining framework to leverage the underexplored large-scale silent surgical procedure videos, automatically retrieving semantically relevant content to enhance the representation learning of narrative videos. Evaluation across 11 datasets for phase recognition and multi-instrument identification shows OphCLIP's robust generalization and superior performance.</description>

Abstract: One of the core challenges of research in quantum computing is concerned with the question whether quantum advantages can be found for near-term quantum circuits that have implications for practical applications. Motivated by this mindset, in this work, we prove an unconditional quantum advantage in the probably approximately correct (PAC) distribution learning framework with shallow quantum circuit hypotheses. We identify a meaningful generative distribution learning problem where constant-depth quantum circuits using one and two qubit gates (QNC^0) are superior compared to constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits (NC^0) as a choice for hypothesis classes. We hence prove a PAC distribution learning separation for shallow quantum circuits over shallow classical circuits. We do so by building on recent results by Bene Watts and Parham on unconditional quantum advantages for sampling tasks with shallow circuits, which we technically uplift to a hyperplane learning problem, identifying non-local correlations as the origin of the quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model(LLM) performance on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have stimulated interest from healthcare providers and patients globally. Particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) facing acute physician shortages and lack of specialists, LLMs offer a potentially scalable pathway to enhance healthcare access and reduce costs. However, their effectiveness in the Global South, especially across the African continent, remains to be established. In this work, we introduce AfriMed-QA, the first large scale Pan-African English multi-specialty medical Question-Answering (QA) dataset, 15,000 questions (open and closed-ended) sourced from over 60 medical schools across 16 countries, covering 32 medical specialties. We further evaluate 30 LLMs across multiple axes including correctness and demographic bias. Our findings show significant performance variation across specialties and geographies, MCQ performance clearly lags USMLE (MedQA). We find that biomedical LLMs underperform general models and smaller edge-friendly LLMs struggle to achieve a passing score. Interestingly, human evaluations show a consistent consumer preference for LLM answers and explanations when compared with clinician answers.</description>

      <title>A catalog of ringed galaxies in the TNG50 simulation: Analysis of their properties and structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The catalog of ringed galaxies was compiled through visual classification of synthetic images from the TNG50 simulation. Galaxies were selected based on specific criteria: a redshift range of $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$, stellar mass $M_\star &gt;10^9 M_\odot$, stellar half-mass radius $r_{50} &gt; 1$ kpc, and specific star formation rate (sSFR), $\rm{log(sSFR/yr}^{-1}) &gt; -13$. Our classification allowed for differentiation between inner rings, outer rings, combinations of rings, and partial rings (pseudo-rings), including barred and non-barred ringed galaxies.
  We constructed a control sample of non-ringed galaxies with similar redshift, stellar mass, and environmental density distributions. We identified 807 ringed galaxies. Approximately 59% possess an inner ring, 22% a partial ring, 12% an outer ring, and 7% have i+o rings. Our statistical analysis reveals that 64% (507 galaxies) exhibit bars. Ringed galaxies exhibit lower efficiency for star formation, reduced gas fractions, redder colors, and higher metallicities compared to non-ringed disk objects. They also show greater variability in metallicity for a given stellar mass.
  From the analysis of radial profiles, galaxies with outer rings exhibit a $r_{50}$ similar to or slightly larger than their control group, while those with inner or partial rings tend to have smaller sizes. A deeper exploration of radial density profiles revealed a pronounced central mass deficit preceding the ring structures, with inner and outer rings located at $r_{50}$ and $1.5 , r_{50}$, respectively. Galaxies with both i+o rings have inner rings that are more compact and massive. Additionally, galaxies with partial rings exhibit deeper mass profiles than their controls, particularly in central areas. These findings improve our understanding of galactic evolution and the complex interplay between mass distribution and morphology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of high-lying states within the charmonium family remains incomplete, particularly in light of recent observations of charmonium states at energies above 4 GeV. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of several high-lying charmonia, focusing on the $D$-, $F$-, and $G$-wave states. A mass spectrum analysis is conducted, incorporating the unquenched effects. We then present a detailed study of the strong decay properties, including partial decay widths for two-body strong decays permitted by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule. Additionally, we explore the primary radiative decay channels associated with these states. Theoretical predictions provided here aim to guide future experimental searches for high-lying charmonium states, particularly at BESIII, Belle II and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Data integration using covariate summaries from external sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern data analysis, information is frequently collected from multiple sources, often leading to challenges such as data heterogeneity and imbalanced sample sizes across datasets. Robust and efficient data integration methods are crucial for improving the generalization and transportability of statistical findings. In this work, we address scenarios where, in addition to having full access to individualized data from a primary source, supplementary covariate information from external sources is also available. While traditional data integration methods typically require individualized covariates from external sources, such requirements can be impractical due to limitations related to accessibility, privacy, storage, and cost. Instead, we propose novel data integration techniques that rely solely on external summary statistics, such as sample means and covariances, to construct robust estimators for the mean outcome under both homogeneous and heterogeneous data settings. Additionally, we extend this framework to causal inference, enabling the estimation of average treatment effects for both generalizability and transportability.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Public Announcement Logic: Base-extension Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics, and base-extension semantics in particular, can be seen as a logical realization of inferentialism, in which the meaning of expressions is understood through their use. We present a base-extension semantics for public announcement logic, building on earlier work giving a base-extension semantics for the modal logic $S5$, which in turn builds on earlier such work for $K$, $KT$, $K4$, and $S4$. These analyses rely on a notion of `modal relation' on bases. The main difficulty in extending the existing B-eS for $S5$ to public announcement logic is to account announcements of the form $[\psi]\phi$, which, in this setting, update the modal relations on bases. We provide a detailed analysis of two classical examples, namely the three-player card game and the muddy children puzzle. These examples illustrate how the inferentialist perspective requires fully explicit information about the state of the participating agents.</description>

      <title>A Method for Building Large Language Models with Predefined KV Cache Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Enhancing Entanglement for Two-Photon-Driven Rabi Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A control scheme is proposed that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance entanglement by modulating the two-photon-driven amplitude in a Rabi model. The quantum phase diagram versus the amplitude of the two-photon process and the coupling between the cavity field and the atom in the Rabi model, is indicated by the energy spectrum of the hybrid system, the witness of entanglement, second order correlation, and negativity of Wigner function. From a dynamical perspective, the behavior of entanglement can reflect the phase transition and the reinforcement learning agent is employed to produce temporal sequences of control pulses to enhance the entanglement in the presence of dissipation. The entanglement can be enhanced in different parameter regimes and the control scheme exhibits robustness against dissipation. The replaceability of the controlled system and the reinforcement learning module demonstrates the generalization of this scheme. This research paves the way of positively enhancing quantum resources in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>On a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morse functions are important objects and tools in understanding topologies of manifolds since the 20th century. Their classification has been natural and difficult problems, and surprisingly, this is recently developing. Since the 2010's, results for cases of surfaces have been presented by Gelbukh, Marzantowicz and Michalak for example. We have also longed for higher dimensional cases. We present a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one. We concentrate on Morse functions such that preimages of single points containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori. Existence of such functions implies that the $3$-dimensional closed and connected manifolds are of such manifolds. This has been shown by Saeki in 2006 and we further study structures of these functions.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Very-high-energy Diffuse Gamma-ray Emissions from the Galactic Plane with LHAASO-WCDA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is a very important tool used to study the propagation and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this work, we report the measurements of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, covering Galactic longitudes from $15^{\circ}$ to $235^{\circ}$ and latitudes from $-5^{\circ}$ to $+5^{\circ}$, in an energy range of 1 TeV to 25 TeV, with the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). After masking the sky regions of known sources, the diffuse emission is detected with $24.6\sigma$ and $9.1\sigma$ significance in the inner Galactic plane($15^{\circ}&lt;l&lt;125^{\circ}$, $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$) and outer Galactic plane ($125^{\circ}&lt;l&lt;235^{\circ}$, $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$), respectively. The WCDA spectra in both regions can be well described by a power-law function, with spectral indices of $-2.67\pm0.05_{\rm stat}$ in the inner region and $-2.83\pm0.19_{\rm stat}$ in the outer region, respectively. Combined with the Square Kilometer Array (KM2A) measurements at higher energies, a clear softening of the spectrum is found in the inner region, with change of spectral indices by $\sim0.5$ at a break energy around $30$ TeV. The fluxes of the diffuse emission are higher by a factor of $1.5-2.7$ than the model prediction assuming local CR spectra and the gas column density, which are consistent with those measured by the KM2A. Along Galactic longitude, the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission shows deviation from that of the gas column density. The spectral shape of the diffuse emission are possibly variation in different longitude region. The results indicate further that the conventional model prediction of diffuse emission from cosmic ray interactions is not enough to account for the observations.</description>

      <title>The fate of EMRI-IMRI pairs in AGN accretion disks: hydrodynamic and three body simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are important gravitational wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It has been recently suggested that EMRIs and IMRIs can both form in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Considering the likely encounter between a sBH and an IMBH during the migration in the AGN disk, Paper I showed that a gap-opening IMBH can drive a surrounding sBH to migrate synchronously. In this work, we extend the study in Paper I with a more sophisticated model. We first use 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study the co-evolution of the disk and the migration of a sBH in the vicinity of an IMBH. We find that the gaseous torque, together with the tidal torque exerted by the IMBH, can drive synchronized migration until $\sim 10$ Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We further use a relativistic three-body code to study the final fate of the sBH in the GW-dominated regime. We find that the sBH can be either captured or kicked out by the IMBH, which will result in either two subsequent IMRIs or an EMRI followed by an IMRI. These events will bring rich information about the formation and evolution of sBHs and IMBHs in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Long Pulse by Short Central Engine: Prompt emission from expanding dissipation rings in the jet front of gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have challenged the long-held opinion that the duration of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is determined by the activity epochs of the central engine. Specifically, the observations of GRB 230307A have revealed a different scenario in which the duration of the prompt emission is predominantly governed by the energy dissipation process following a brief initial energy injection from the central engine. In this paper, we explore a mechanism where the energy injection from the central engine initially causes turbulence in a small region and radiates locally. This turbulence then propagates to more distant regions and radiates. Consequently, the emission regions form concentric rings that extend outward. Using an idealized toy model, we show that such a mechanism, initiated by a pulsed energy injection, can produce a prompt emission light curve resembling a single broad pulse exhibiting the typical softer-wider/softer-later feature. Under some parameters, the main characteristics of the GRB 230307A spectra and light curves can be reproduced by the toy model.</description>

      <title>The bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk-metallicity determination of giant exoplanets is essential to constrain their formation and evolution pathways and to compare them to the solar system. Previous studies inferred an inverse relation between the mass and bulk metallicity. However, the data almost exclusively contained planets that orbit FGK stars. The recent discoveries of giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars present an opportunity to probe whether they follow a mass-metallicity trend different from that of their FGK counterparts. Using evolution models we characterised the interiors of giant exoplanets with reliable mass-radius measurements that orbit FGK and M-dwarf stars. We then inferred the mass-metallicity trends for both populations. We found that the bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars is overall lower compared to those around FGK stars. This yielded mass-metallicity relations for the two populations with similar slopes but significantly different offsets. The lack of metal-rich giant planets around M dwarfs could explain the difference in the inferred offset and be a result of different formation conditions. However, there were only 20 successful bulk-metallicity retrievals for the giant planets around M dwarfs, which resulted in rather large uncertainties. Therefore, it is of great importance to continue detecting these planets with both transit and radial velocities. Additionally, the characterisation of the atmospheres of giant planets around M-stars can further help to constrain their interiors and to investigate the atmosphere-interior connection. This will significantly contribute towards understanding the possible formation pathways of giant planets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity in the context of Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonic ensemble for the bosonic and fermionic cases. Specifically, we find that the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ satisfy the linear relations with respect to $n$. It is found that $\{b_n\}$ is independent of the chemical potentials while $\{a_n\}$ depends on the chemical potentials. The resulting Krylov complexities for both bosonic and fermionic cases behave similarly, which is due to the similar profiles of the square of the absolute values of the auto-correlation functions. In the late time, the Krylov complexity exhibits exponential growth with the asymptotic scaling significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of $\{b_n\}$, which is different from that in the relativistic field theory. We argue that this is because the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_n\}$ also contributes to the Krylov complexity.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Robust Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Network with Single-Step Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with a Noise-Conditional Framework (NCF) remain challenging for 3D scene understanding tasks, as the complex geometric details in scenes increase the difficulty of fitting the gradients of the data distribution (the scores) from semantic labels. This also results in longer training and inference time for DDPMs compared to non-DDPMs. From a different perspective, we delve deeply into the model paradigm dominated by the Conditional Network. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end robust semantic \textbf{Seg}mentation \textbf{Net}work based on a \textbf{C}onditional-Noise Framework (CNF) of D\textbf{D}PMs, named \textbf{CDSegNet}. Specifically, CDSegNet models the Noise Network (NN) as a learnable noise-feature generator. This enables the Conditional Network (CN) to understand 3D scene semantics under multi-level feature perturbations, enhancing the generalization in unseen scenes. Meanwhile, benefiting from the noise system of DDPMs, CDSegNet exhibits strong noise and sparsity robustness in experiments. Moreover, thanks to CNF, CDSegNet can generate the semantic labels in a single-step inference like non-DDPMs, due to avoiding directly fitting the scores from semantic labels in the dominant network of CDSegNet. On public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, CDSegNet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a theorem of Bender, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey on counting subspaces with a given profile with respect to a simple operator. Counting such subspaces is equivalent to the problem of determining the $q$-Whittaker coefficients in the expansion of the power sum symmetric function. As a consequence we obtain a result of Chen and Tseng which answers a problem of Niederreiter on splitting subspaces.</description>

      <title>All Languages Matter: Evaluating LMMs on Culturally Diverse 100 Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) generally focus on only a few regions and languages. As LMMs continue to improve, it is increasingly important to ensure they understand cultural contexts, respect local sensitivities, and support low-resource languages, all while effectively integrating corresponding visual cues. In pursuit of culturally diverse global multimodal models, our proposed All Languages Matter Benchmark (ALM-bench) represents the largest and most comprehensive effort to date for evaluating LMMs across 100 languages. ALM-bench challenges existing models by testing their ability to understand and reason about culturally diverse images paired with text in various languages, including many low-resource languages traditionally underrepresented in LMM research. The benchmark offers a robust and nuanced evaluation framework featuring various question formats, including true/false, multiple choice, and open-ended questions, which are further divided into short and long-answer categories. ALM-bench design ensures a comprehensive assessment of a model's ability to handle varied levels of difficulty in visual and linguistic reasoning. To capture the rich tapestry of global cultures, ALM-bench carefully curates content from 13 distinct cultural aspects, ranging from traditions and rituals to famous personalities and celebrations. Through this, ALM-bench not only provides a rigorous testing ground for state-of-the-art open and closed-source LMMs but also highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic inclusivity, encouraging the development of models that can serve diverse global populations effectively. Our benchmark is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Factorized Visual Tokenization and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual tokenizers are fundamental to image generation. They convert visual data into discrete tokens, enabling transformer-based models to excel at image generation. Despite their success, VQ-based tokenizers like VQGAN face significant limitations due to constrained vocabulary sizes. Simply expanding the codebook often leads to training instability and diminishing performance gains, making scalability a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce Factorized Quantization (FQ), a novel approach that revitalizes VQ-based tokenizers by decomposing a large codebook into multiple independent sub-codebooks. This factorization reduces the lookup complexity of large codebooks, enabling more efficient and scalable visual tokenization. To ensure each sub-codebook captures distinct and complementary information, we propose a disentanglement regularization that explicitly reduces redundancy, promoting diversity across the sub-codebooks. Furthermore, we integrate representation learning into the training process, leveraging pretrained vision models like CLIP and DINO to infuse semantic richness into the learned representations. This design ensures our tokenizer captures diverse semantic levels, leading to more expressive and disentangled representations. Experiments show that the proposed FQGAN model substantially improves the reconstruction quality of visual tokenizers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that this tokenizer can be effectively adapted into auto-regressive image generation. https://showlab.github.io/FQGAN</description>

      <title>ProteinWeaver: A Divide-and-Assembly Approach for Protein Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature creates diverse proteins through a 'divide and assembly' strategy. Inspired by this idea, we introduce ProteinWeaver, a two-stage framework for protein backbone design. Our method first generates individual protein domains and then employs an SE(3) diffusion model to flexibly assemble these domains. A key challenge lies in the assembling step, given the complex and rugged nature of the inter-domain interaction landscape. To address this challenge, we employ preference alignment to discern complex relationships between structure and interaction landscapes through comparative analysis of generated samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ProteinWeaver: (1) generates high-quality, novel protein backbones through versatile domain assembly; (2) outperforms RFdiffusion, the current state-of-the-art in backbone design, by 13\% and 39\% for long-chain proteins; (3) shows the potential for cooperative function design through illustrative case studies. To sum up, by introducing a `divide-and-assembly' paradigm, ProteinWeaver advances protein engineering and opens new avenues for functional protein design.</description>

      <title>Phys4DGen: A Physics-Driven Framework for Controllable and Efficient 4D Content Generation from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of 4D content generation involves creating dynamic 3D models that evolve over time in response to specific input conditions, such as images. Existing methods rely heavily on pre-trained video diffusion models to guide 4D content dynamics, but these approaches often fail to capture essential physical principles, as video diffusion models lack a robust understanding of real-world physics. Moreover, these models face challenges in providing fine-grained control over dynamics and exhibit high computational costs. In this work, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel, high-efficiency framework that generates physics-compliant 4D content from a single image with enhanced control capabilities. Our approach uniquely integrates physical simulations into the 4D generation pipeline, ensuring adherence to fundamental physical laws. Inspired by the human ability to infer physical properties visually, we introduce a Physical Perception Module (PPM) that discerns the material properties and structural components of the 3D object from the input image, facilitating accurate downstream simulations. Phys4DGen significantly accelerates the 4D generation process by eliminating iterative optimization steps in the dynamics modeling phase. It allows users to intuitively control the movement speed and direction of generated 4D content by adjusting external forces, achieving finely tunable, physically plausible animations. Extensive evaluations show that Phys4DGen outperforms existing methods in both inference speed and physical realism, producing high-quality, controllable 4D content.

      <description>arXiv:2411.16820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.</description>

Abstract: This short text tried to establish a big picture of what evidential statistics is about and how an ideal inference method should behave. Moreover, by examining shortcomings of some of the currently used methods for measuring evidence and utilizing some intuitive principles, we motivated the Relative Belief Ratio as the primary method of characterizing statistical evidence. Number of topics has been omitted for the interest of this text and the reader is strongly advised to refer to (Evans, 2015) as the primary source for further readings of the subject.</description>

      <title>Enabling Adoption of Regenerative Agriculture through Soil Carbon Copilots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize environ mental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.</description>

      <title>A New Herwig7 Underlying Event Tune: from RHIC to LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present parameter sets corresponding to new underlying event tunes for the Herwig7.3 Monte Carlo event generator. The existing Herwig tunes are in good agreement with LHC data, however, they are not typically designed for center-of-mass energies below $\sqrt{s}=300$ GeV. The tunes presented in this study can describe mid-rapidity data collected at the nominal RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s }=200$ GeV, as well as higher center-of-mass energies utilized by experiments elsewhere, such as the LHC. The base "New Haven" tune is developed by fitting minimum-bias simulations of proton-proton collisions to mid-rapidity identified hadron and jet data from the STAR experiment. The "Nashville" tune includes a separate set of parameters developed by tuning to Tevatron proton-antiproton data at $\sqrt{s}=300$, $900$ and $1960$ GeV from CDF, and LHC proton-proton measurements from CMS at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, in addition to the STAR measurements. Both new tunes demonstrate significant improvements over the recommended default tune currently included in the latest version of Herwig for minimum bias production. As such, we advocate using these tunes for future simulation studies at mid-rapidity by the experimental collaborations at RHIC (STAR and sPHENIX) and the LHC (ATLAS, ALICE, CMS).</description>

      <title>MotionWavelet: Human Motion Prediction via Wavelet Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling temporal characteristics and the non-stationary dynamics of body movement plays a significant role in predicting human future motions. However, it is challenging to capture these features due to the subtle transitions involved in the complex human motions. This paper introduces MotionWavelet, a human motion prediction framework that utilizes Wavelet Transformation and studies human motion patterns in the spatial-frequency domain. In MotionWavelet, a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) learns a Wavelet Manifold by applying Wavelet Transformation on the motion data therefore encoding the intricate spatial and temporal motion patterns. Once the Wavelet Manifold is built, WDM trains a diffusion model to generate human motions from Wavelet latent vectors. In addition to the WDM, MotionWavelet also presents a Wavelet Space Shaping Guidance mechanism to refine the denoising process to improve conformity with the manifold structure. WDM also develops Temporal Attention-Based Guidance to enhance prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MotionWavelet, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and enhanced generalization across various benchmarks. Our code and models will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Quantile Graph Discovery through QuACC: Quantile Association via Conditional Concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical structure learning is an effective way to assess and visualize cross-biomarker dependencies in biomedical settings. Standard approaches to estimating graphs rely on conditional independence tests that may not be sensitive to associations that manifest at the tails of joint distributions, i.e., they may miss connections among variables that exhibit associations mainly at lower or upper quantiles. In this work, we propose a novel measure of quantile-specific conditional association called QuACC: Quantile Association via Conditional Concordance. For a pair of variables and a conditioning set, QuACC quantifies agreement between the residuals from two quantile regression models, which may be linear or more complex, e.g., quantile forests. Using this measure as the basis for a test of null (quantile) association, we introduce a new class of quantile-specific graphical models. Through simulation we show our method is powerful for detecting dependencies under dependencies that manifest at the tails of distributions. We apply our method to biobank data from All of Us and identify quantile-specific patterns of conditional association in a multivariate setting.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Did the terrestrial planets of the Solar System form by pebble accretion?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morbidelli, Kleine &amp; Nimmo (2024) (MKN) recently published a critical analysis on whether the terrestrial planets in the Solar System formed by rapid pebble accretion or by the classical route of multiple giant impacts between planetary embryos after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. They arrive at the conclusion that the terrestrial planets did not form by pebble accretion. Although we welcome debate on this topic, we want to emphasize here several points that we disagree on. We will not address in detail every claim made in MKN, but rather stick to four main points. Our conclusion is that pebble accretion remains a viable mechanism to drive significant growth of protoplanets in the protoplanetary disc, with as much as 70% of Earth formed by pebble accretion. This rapid growth phase must nevertheless have been followed by an extended period of collisional growth after the end of the protoplanetary disc phase, likely culminating with the moon-forming giant impact. We emphasize here an important recent result from Olson &amp; Sharp (2023), namely that significant growth by pebble accretion can be reconciled with the Hf-W decay system even for a canonical moon-forming giant impact with a Mars-mass protoplanet and a low equilibration efficiency - a more massive impactor, as proposed in Johansen et al. (2023), is not necessary. Given that terrestrial planet formation naturally involves both pebble accretion and a combination of small and large impactors, this challenges the very notion of making an either/or distinction between the classical collision model and the pebble accretion model.</description>

      <title>Robust Max-Min Fair Beamforming Design for Rate Splitting Multiple Access-aided Visible Light Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust beamforming design for rate splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided visible light communication (VLC) networks with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In particular, we first derive the theoretical lower bound for the channel capacity of RSMA-aided VLC networks. Then we investigate the beamforming design to solve the max-min fairness (MMF) problem of RSMA-aided VLC networks under the practical optical power constraint and electrical power constraint while considering the practical imperfect CSIT scenario. To address the problem, we propose a constrained-concave-convex programming (CCCP)-based beamforming design algorithm which exploits semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a penalty method to deal with the rank-one constraint caused by SDR. Numerical results show that the proposed robust beamforming design algorithm for RSMA-aided VLC network achieves a superior performance over the existing ones for space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

Abstract: The o1 system card identifies the o1 models as the most robust within OpenAI, with their defining characteristic being the progression from rapid, intuitive thinking to slower, more deliberate reasoning. This observation motivated us to investigate the influence of System-2 thinking patterns on model safety. In our preliminary research, we conducted safety evaluations of the o1 model, including complex jailbreak attack scenarios using adversarial natural language prompts and mathematical encoding prompts. Our findings indicate that the o1 model demonstrates relatively improved safety performance; however, it still exhibits vulnerabilities, particularly against jailbreak attacks employing mathematical encoding. Through detailed case analysis, we identified specific patterns in the o1 model's responses. We also explored the alignment of System-2 safety in open-source models using prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning techniques. Experimental results show that some simple methods to encourage the model to carefully scrutinize user requests are beneficial for model safety. Additionally, we proposed a implementation plan for process supervision to enhance safety alignment. The implementation details and experimental results will be provided in future versions.</description>

      <title>Remark on Laplacians and Riemannian Submersions with Totally Geodesic Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian submersion $(M,g) \to (B,j)$ each of whose fiber is connected and totally geodesic, we consider a certain 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $(g_{t})_{t &gt; 0}$ on $M$, which is called the canonical variation. Let $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})$ be the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta_{g_{t}}$ and $\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})$ the volume of $(M, g_{t})$. In 1982, B\'{e}rard-Bergery and Bourguignon showed that the scale-invariant quantity $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $0$ with $t$. In this paper, we prove that if each fiber is Einstein and $(M,g)$ satisfies a certain condition about its Ricci curvature, then $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $\infty$ with $t$. We consider many examples. In particular, we consider Riemannian submersions from compact rank one symmetric spaces and the twistor fibration of a quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold of positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>The deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ in massive star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.</description>

Abstract: We show removability of half-line singularities for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic PDEs which have classical density and a Jacobi inequality. An example of such a PDE is the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, and the original proof follows from Caffarelli 1990. Other examples are the minimal surface and special Lagrangian equations. The present paper's quick doubling proof combines Savin's small perturbation theorem with the Jacobi inequality. The method more generally removes singularities satisfying the single side condition.</description>

      <title>A Novel Word Pair-based Gaussian Sentence Similarity Algorithm For Bengali Extractive Text Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extractive Text Summarization is the process of selecting the most representative parts of a larger text without losing any key information. Recent attempts at extractive text summarization in Bengali, either relied on statistical techniques like TF-IDF or used naive sentence similarity measures like the word averaging technique. All of these strategies suffer from expressing semantic relationships correctly. Here, we propose a novel Word pair-based Gaussian Sentence Similarity (WGSS) algorithm for calculating the semantic relation between two sentences. WGSS takes the geometric means of individual Gaussian similarity values of word embedding vectors to get the semantic relationship between sentences. It compares two sentences on a word-to-word basis which rectifies the sentence representation problem faced by the word averaging method. The summarization process extracts key sentences by grouping semantically similar sentences into clusters using the Spectral Clustering algorithm. After clustering, we use TF-IDF ranking to pick the best sentence from each cluster. The proposed method is validated using four different datasets, and it outperformed other recent models by 43.2% on average ROUGE scores (ranging from 2.5% to 95.4%). It is also experimented on other low-resource languages i.e. Turkish, Marathi, and Hindi language, where we find that the proposed method performs as similar as Bengali for these languages. In addition, a new high-quality Bengali dataset is curated which contains 250 articles and a pair of summaries for each of them. We believe this research is a crucial addition to Bengali Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and it can easily be extended into other low-resource languages. We made the implementation of the proposed model and data public on https://github.com/FMOpee/WGSS.</description>

      <title>SelfSplat: Pose-Free and 3D Prior-Free Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose SelfSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to perform pose-free and 3D prior-free generalizable 3D reconstruction from unposed multi-view images. These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code and pretrained models are available at https://gynjn.github.io/selfsplat/</description>

      <title>Promptable Anomaly Segmentation with SAM Through Self-Perception Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great progress in anomaly segmentation tasks due to its impressive generalization ability. However, existing methods that directly apply SAM through prompting often overlook the domain shift issue, where SAM performs well on natural images but struggles in industrial scenarios. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a promising solution, but it may yield suboptimal performance by not adequately addressing the perception challenges during adaptation to anomaly images. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Perceptinon Tuning (SPT) method, aiming to enhance SAM's perception capability for anomaly segmentation. The SPT method incorporates a self-drafting tuning strategy, which generates an initial coarse draft of the anomaly mask, followed by a refinement process. Additionally, a visual-relation-aware adapter is introduced to improve the perception of discriminative relational information for mask generation. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method can significantly outperform baseline methods, validating its effectiveness. Models and codes will be available online.</description>

      <title>RealTraj: Towards Real-World Pedestrian Trajectory Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper jointly addresses three key limitations in conventional pedestrian trajectory forecasting: pedestrian perception errors, real-world data collection costs, and person ID annotation costs. We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</description>

Abstract: The growth of semiconductor technology is unprecedented, with profound transformational consequences for society. This includes feeding an over-reliance on digital solutions to systemic problems such as climate change ('techno-solutionism'). Such technologies come at a cost: environmental, social and material. We unpack topics arising from "The True Cost of ICT: From Materiality to Techno-Solutionism (TCICT)", a workshop held at the International ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S) conference 2024 in Stockholm, Sweden -- exploring, as a matter of global climate injustice, the drivers and material dependencies of these technologies. We point to the importance of addressing ICT's impacts as a system, rather than purely in terms of efficiency and energy use. We conclude by calling to build a community of like-minded and critical colleagues to address the intersectional climate impacts of the semiconductor industry and the techno-solutionism it embodies.</description>

      <title>Robustness of tripartite entangled states in passive PT-symmetric qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems have attracted significant interest in recent years due to the presence of unique spectral singularities known as exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. The drastic changes in these systems around their EPs have led to unique entanglement dynamics, which remained elusive until quite recently. In this work, we theoretically investigate the robustness of tripartite entanglement induced by EPs of the passive PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, both in stand-alone configurations and hybrid setups with Hermitian qubits. In particular, we consider the qubits with both all-to-all and nearest-neighbour couplings under uniform and non-uniform coupling strengths. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian qubits with all-to-all coupling generate GHZ states, while those with nearest-neighbour interactions produce W states. These entangled states are resilient to non-uniform couplings and off-resonant driving fields. Moreover, the hybrid configurations combining Hermitian and non-Hermitian qubits suggest the importance of EPs for generating and maintaining genuine tripartite entanglement in our system. Additionally, driving the PT-symmetric qubits with a strong Rabi frequency can help sustain tripartite entanglement over time by countering losses, while strong inter-qubit coupling can benefit these entangled states in the low dissipation regime. These findings suggest that exploiting non-Hermitian systems and their associated EPs can create robust entangled states which are useful for both fundamental studies and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Decomposing physically-based materials from images into their constituent properties remains challenging, particularly when maintaining both computational efficiency and physical consistency. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown promise, they face substantial computational overhead due to multiple denoising steps and separate models for different material properties. We present SuperMat, a single-step framework that achieves high-quality material decomposition with one-step inference. This enables end-to-end training with perceptual and re-render losses while decomposing albedo, metallic, and roughness maps at millisecond-scale speeds. We further extend our framework to 3D objects through a UV refinement network, enabling consistent material estimation across viewpoints while maintaining efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SuperMat achieves state-of-the-art PBR material decomposition quality while reducing inference time from seconds to milliseconds per image, and completes PBR material estimation for 3D objects in approximately 3 seconds.

      <title>Isotropy Matters: Soft-ZCA Whitening of Embeddings for Semantic Code Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low isotropy in an embedding space impairs performance on tasks involving semantic inference. Our study investigates the impact of isotropy on semantic code search performance and explores post-processing techniques to mitigate this issue. We analyze various code language models, examine isotropy in their embedding spaces, and its influence on search effectiveness. We propose a modified ZCA whitening technique to control isotropy levels in embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Soft-ZCA whitening improves the performance of pre-trained code language models and can complement contrastive fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

Abstract: The 2024 PACE Challenge focused on the One-Sided Crossing Minimization (OCM) problem, which aims to minimize edge crossings in a bipartite graph with a fixed order in one partition and a free order in the other. We describe our OCM solver submission that utilizes various reduction rules for OCM and, for the heuristic track, employs local search approaches as well as techniques to escape local minima. The exact and parameterized solver uses an ILP formulation and branch &amp; bound to solve an equivalent Feedback Arc Set instance.</description>

      <title>Tjurina spectrum and graded symmetry of missing spectral numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hypersurface isolated singularity defined by $f$, the Steenbrink spectrum can be obtained as the Poincar\'e polynomial of the graded quotients of the $V$-filtration on the Jacobian ring of $f$. The Tjurina subspectrum is defined by replacing the Jacobian ring with its quotient by the image of the multiplication by $f$. We prove that their difference (consisting of missing spectral numbers) has a canonical graded symmetry. This follows from the self-duality of the Jacobian ring, which is compatible with the action of $f$ as well as the $V$-filtration. It implies for instance that the number of missing spectral numbers which are smaller than $(n+1)/2$ (with $n$ the ambient dimension) is bounded by $[(\mu-\tau)/2]$. We can moreover improve the estimate of Brian\c{c}on-Skoda exponent in the semisimple monodromy case.</description>

      <title>A Combined Feature Embedding Tools for Multi-Class Software Defect and Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In software, a vulnerability is a defect in a program that attackers might utilize to acquire unauthorized access, alter system functions, and acquire information. These vulnerabilities arise from programming faults, design flaws, incorrect setups, and a lack of security protective measures. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, regular software upgrades, code reviews, safe development techniques, and the use of security tools to find and fix problems have been important. Several ways have been delivered in recent studies to address difficulties related to software vulnerabilities. However, previous approaches have significant limitations, notably in feature embedding and precisely recognizing specific vulnerabilities. To overcome these drawbacks, we present CodeGraphNet, an experimental method that combines GraphCodeBERT and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approaches, where, CodeGraphNet reveals data in a high-dimensional vector space, with comparable or related properties grouped closer together. This method captures intricate relationships between features, providing for more exact identification and separation of vulnerabilities. Using this feature embedding approach, we employed four machine learning models, applying both independent testing and 10-fold cross-validation. The DeepTree model, which is a hybrid of a Decision Tree and a Neural Network, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In additional validation, we evaluated our model using feature embeddings from LSA, GloVe, FastText, CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, and found that the CodeGraphNet method presented improved vulnerability identification with 98% of accuracy. Our model was tested on a real-time dataset to determine its capacity to handle real-world data and to focus on defect localization, which might influence future studies.</description>

      <title>Could the neutrino emission of TXS 0506+056 come from the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS~0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS~0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS~0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons due to the synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>Searching for star-planet interactions in GJ 486 at radio wavelengths with the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for radio emission from star-planet interactions in the M-dwarf system GJ~486, which hosts an Earth-like planet. We observed the GJ~486 system with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) from 550 to 750 MHz in nine different epochs, between October 2021 and February 2022, covering almost all orbital phases of GJ~486 b from different orbital cycles. We obtained radio images and dynamic spectra of the total and circularly polarized intensity for each individual epoch We do not detect any quiescent radio emission in any epoch above 3$\sigma$. Similarly, we do not detect any bursty emission in our dynamic spectra.
  While we cannot completely rule out that the absence of a radio detection is due to time variability of the radio emission, or to the maximum electron-cyclotron maser emission being below our observing range, this seems unlikely. We discuss two possible scenarios: an intrinsic dim radio signal, or alternatively, that the anisotropic beamed emission pointed away from the observer. If the non-detection of radio emission from star-planet interaction in GJ~486 is due to an intrinsically dim signal, this implies that, independently of whether the planet is magnetized or not, the mass-loss rate is small (\dot{M}_\star $\lesssim$ 0.3 \dot{M}_\sun) and that, concomitantly, the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into radio emission must be low ($\beta \lesssim 10^{-3}$). Free-free absorption effects are negligible, given the high value of the coronal temperature. Finally, if the anisotropic beaming pointed away from us, this would imply that GJ~486 has very low values of its magnetic obliquity and inclination.</description>

      <title>Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs: Scaling Laws for Quantized LLMs with 100T Training Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal that low-bit quantization favors undertrained large language models (LLMs) by observing that models with larger sizes or fewer training tokens experience less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) when applying low-bit quantization, whereas smaller models with extensive training tokens suffer significant QiD. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.
  With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable. This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research. To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.</description>

      <title>StableAnimator: High-Quality Identity-Preserving Human Image Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents StableAnimator, the first end-to-end ID-preserving video diffusion framework, which synthesizes high-quality videos without any post-processing, conditioned on a reference image and a sequence of poses. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator begins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors, respectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image embeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder. Then, StableAnimator introduces a novel distribution-aware ID Adapter that prevents interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via alignment. During inference, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimization to further enhance the face quality. We demonstrate that solving the HJB equation can be integrated into the diffusion denoising process, and the resulting solution constrains the denoising path and thus benefits ID preservation. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>
